Argued on: 05.11.2018

Judgment on: 07.02.2019

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

Petitioners to the present application had come before this court alleging the violation

of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) and 14 (1)(g) of the Constitution by the

letters of appointment dated 18.08.2015 issued by the 1st Respondent.

This court on 08.09.2016, granted leave to proceed for the said violations as alleged by the

Petitioners.

The Petitioners had been recruited to the Irrigation Department at various offices and project sites

Island wide and at the time they were recruited all of them had passed the G.C.E. Ordinary Level

Examination at least in 6 subjects including Language or Literature and Mathematics.

As submitted by the Petitioners, some of them have recruited as far back as year 2002 and have

been granted casual or contract appointments, as Clerks, Management Assistants or Typists.

7 Having joined the Irrigation Department on casual and/or contract basis, the Petitioners continued

to serve the department until Public Administration Circular 25/2014 was issued by the Ministry of

Public Administration and Home Affairs on 12.11.2014. (P-24)

At the time the said circular was issued, the Petitioners have served the Irrigation Department as

reflected in the following chart;

1st Petitioner 11 years and 11 months

2nd Petitioner 09 years and 02 months

3rd Petitioner 07 years and 04 months

4th Petitioner 06 years and 06 months

5th Petitioner 06 years and 06 months

6th Petitioner 05 years and 02 months

7th Petitioner 06 years and 05 months

8th Petitioner 05 years and 04 months

9th Petitioner 04 years and 08 months

10th Petitioner 04 years and 06 months

11th Petitioner 03 years and 08 months

12th Petitioner 03 years and 05 months

13th Petitioner 02 years

14th Petitioner 02 years and 02 months

15th Petitioner 02 years and 09 months

16th Petitioner 02 years and 04 months

17th Petitioner 02 years and 05 months

18th Petitioner 01 years and 04 months

8 19th Petitioner 04 years and 05 months

20th Petitioner 01 year and 09 months

21st Petitioner 01 year and 04 months

22nd Petitioner 10 months

The said circular which provided for casual/ contract employees to be made permanent, had

provided as follows;

“The Government has decided as per budget proposals 2015 to grant permanent

appointments with effect from 24.10.2014 to the employees who have been

recruited and are still in the service on Temporary, Casual (on daily wages),

Substitute, Contract or Relief basis to serve in Public Service, Provincial Public

Service and State Corporations and Statutory Boards.

2. Accordingly, permanent appointments are granted to the employees who

have completed a continuous and satisfactory service of 180 days in the

posts belonging to following service categories as at 24.10.2014.

a) Primary Grade – Unskilled (PL 01) / (U-PL1)

b) Primary Grade –Semi Skilled (PL 02)/ (U-PL2)

c) Primary Grade –Skilled (PL 03)/ (U-PL3)

d) Management Assistant- Non Technical Segment 02 (MN 01)/ (U-MN1)

e) Management Assistant- Technical Segment 03 (MT 01)

f) Management Assistant- Non Technical C1 (MA 1-1)

g) Management Assistant- Non Technical C2 (MA 1-2)

9

3. It is sufficient for these employees belonging to service categories

mentioned in (a), (b) and (c) above, to have passed at least Grade 08/ Year

09 for the purpose of granting permanent appointments. However, the

employees belonging to the service categories mentioned in (d), (e), (f) and

(g) above, shall have passed G.C.E. (O/L) Examination at least in 06 subjects

including Language or Literature and Mathematics.

4. Relevant appointing authorities shall take action to grant permanent

appointments with effect from 24.10.2014 to all employees, who become

eligible as per the provisions of this circular, in the same posts to which they

have been recruited under the service categories mentioned above.”

Since the 1st to the 22nd Petitioners referred to above had fulfilled the requirement under Public

Administration Circular 25/2014 the appointing authority, the 1st Respondent had taken steps to

implement the said circular by appointing the Petitioners to the posts, the Petitioners said to have

been recruited by the Irrigation Department.

Accordingly the 1st Respondent had issued letters of appointment on 17.11.2014 appointing the 1st

to the 22nd Petitioners to the post of clerk with effect from 24.10.2014 in the Irrigation

Department. The said letters of appointment issued to the 22 Petitioners are produced marked

P-28 (i) to (xxii).

As complained by the Petitioners before the Supreme Court, the 1st Respondent, the appointing

authority by his letters of appointment dated 18.08.2015, ten months after the original letters of

appointment issued to them, appointed them to the post of labourer with effect from 24.10.2014

and cancelled the earlier letters issued to them on 17.11.2014.

10 Being aggrieved by the said decision of the 1st Respondent to appoint the Petitioners as labourers

by letter dated 18.08.2015, the Petitioners filed the instant application and in addition to the

declaration of their fundamental rights had been violated by the said decision, the Petitioners

have further prayed for a declaration that P29 (i) to P29 (xxii) are null and void and that P28 (i) to

P28 (xxii) are legally valid.

As further submitted by the Petitioners, they were considered as clerks, Management Assistants,

Typists for all purposes of the department and several documents were produced in support of

the above contention. In this regard our attention was drawn to several documents including,

letters of appointment with regard to the appointments of 3rd and 5th Petitioners for the post of

clerks by P3(f), P5(d) and several service letters issued by their immediate supervising officer

marked P3(e), P4(g), P5(e), P6(j), P9(h), P10 (i), P17(g) and P20(e) by 3rd, 4th,5th, 6th, 9th,10th,17th

and 20th Petitioners

In addition to the above documents, the Petitioners have produced under P-23 (a)-(l) the duty lists

issued to some of the Petitioners to establish that the Petitioners were assigned with clerical jobs

at their work places.

When considering the material placed before this court I have no doubt that all the Petitioners to

the instant application were assigned with duties of Clerks, Computer Programmers, Typists etc.

but not as labourers in their respective work places.

Paragraph 4 of the Public Administration Circular 25/2014, which identifies the eligibility criteria of

a casual employee to be made a permanent, requires that,

“Who become eligible as per the provisions of this circular, in the same posts to

which they have been recruited under the service categories mentioned above.”

11 Paragraph 5 of the said circular had further provided,

“Once relevant appointments are granted, it shall be reported promptly to the

Director General Management Services in accordance with the specimen attached

herewith in order to update the staff of each institution.”

As reveled before this court, once the appointments were made by the 1st Respondent as

reflected in P28(i)-(xxii), steps had been taken to report the said appointments to the Director

General Management Services under the above provision of the circular.

The 1st Respondent, who said to have issued P28-(i)-(xxii) had now taken up the position that,

“when information relating to the appointments were reported to the Director General of

Management Services as required by the said circular, it was observed by the said Director

General that such appointments had been made contrary to the provisions of clause 4 of the said

circular. In this regard the 1st Respondent had received specific instructions to adhere to the above

provisions of the circular by letter dated 18.03.2015 which reads as follows;

2. “………….ia:sr m;aùu m%Odkh lr we;s kdu f,aLkh mrSCId lsrSfïoS rdcH

12 As further submitted by the 1st Respondent, subsequent letters of appointment issued to the

Petitioner as reflected in P29 (i)-(xxii) had been issued, by carefully going through the relevant

documents maintained at the respective offices and after being satisfied the exact post to which

each and every Petitioner had been recruited by the Irrigation Department. It is the position taken

by the 1st Respondent that all the Petitioners before this court had been recruited as casual/

contract labourers and their salaries were paid on check roll maintained at the respective offices,

for the payment of salaries to the daily paid labourers.

Even though some of the Petitioners have made an attempt to challenge the above position, their

own documents filed before this court had confirmed the position taken up by the 1st Respondent.

I have gone through some of the documents relied by the Petitioners which reads as follows;

a) Service letter issued to the 1st Petitioner P1(h)

“'''''''''''' hk wh lïlre ;k;=re kdufhka fiajfha fhojdf.k wju

ffoksl jegqma f.jkq ,enqjo''''''''”

Even though the 10th Petitioner was careful not to submit any document revealing the fact that

she was originally employed as a labourer, the 1st Respondent had submitted the Daily Paid

Employees Service Record to confirm that her designation is casual labourer (1CR2).

When going through the above documents, it appears that the Petitioners were recruited as

casual labourers and paid the salary of a casual labourer even though some of them have been

issued with letters of appointments, service letters and duty lists as Management Assistant, Clerks,

Typists and/or Computer Operators.

As observed by me, the circular 25/2014 referred to above, had provided clear guidelines in order

to make the casual /contract employees permanent in the government service, based on the

service category to which the employee had been previously recruited. Director General

Management Service by his letter dated 18.03.2015 advised the 1st Respondent to comply with

the provisions of the said circular to avoid in equality among the other employees who will be

absorbed to the government service based on the same circular.

14 In the case of C.W. Mackie and Company Ltd. V. Hugh Molagoda, Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue and others [1986] 1 Sri LR 300 the Supreme Court observed that,

“In order sustain the plea of discrimination based upon Article 12 (1) a party will have to

satisfy the court about two things:

1. That he has been treated differently from others

2. That he has been differently treated from persons similarly circumstanced without any

reasonable basis.”

The Petitioners in the present case has failed to establish both, that they have been treated

differently from others and that they have been differently treated from persons similarly

circumstanced when implementing the provisions of the Public Administrative circular 25 of 2014.

In the case of Elomre Perera V. Major Montegue Jayawickrema Minister of Public Administration

and Plantation Industries and others [1985] 1 Sri LR 285 the Supreme Court held that Article 14

(1) (g) only recognizes a general right in every citizen to do work of particular kind and of his

choice. It does not confer the right to hold a particular job or to occupy a particular post of one’s

choice.

As observed by me the Petitioners wanted the provisions of Public Administration circular 25/2014

be applicable to them as reflected in P28(i)-(xxii) when they are absorbed to the Government

service, but not as reflected in P29 (i)-(xxii). By P29 (i)-(xxii) all the Petitioners were absorbed into

the government service as labourers and by issuing those letters of appointment, the Respondents

have not violated the Article 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution.

15 For the reasons given above I see no merit in the application before this court. The Petitioners

failed to establish that their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) and 14 (1) (g) had

been violated by the conduct of the above Respondents.

This application is accordingly dismissed, I make no order with regard to costs.

Application dismissed. No costs.
