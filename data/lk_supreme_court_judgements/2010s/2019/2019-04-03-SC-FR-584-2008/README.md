Rajiv Goonatilake SSC for the Attorney General Argued on : 25.3.2019 Decided on : 3.4.2019

Sisira J de Abrew J

The Petitioner has filed a petition dated 8.1.2009 in this court alleging that her

fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been

violated by the Respondents. This court by its order dated 13.1.2009 granted leave

to proceed for alleged violation of the fundamental rights of the Petitioner. The

Petitioner in her petition states that she made an application to the post of Grama

Niladhari in Welivitiya, Divithura Divisional Secretariat Division; that she

obtained 132 marks from the competitive examination; that she and four (4) others

were called for an interview on 28.1.2008; that she obtained seven (7) marks from

the interview; that 5th and 6th Respondents who were not called for the interview on

29.1.2008 were appointed as Grama Niladharis but she was not appointed; that 5th

and 6th Respondents were interviewed by a board of interview which is different

SC FR 584/2008

from the board of interview which interviewed the Petitioner; and that her

fundamental rights had been violated by the Respondents.

The main point urged by learned Presidents Counsel (PC) for the Petitioner was

that the 5th and 6th Respondents were not called for the interview on the same day

that the Petitioner was called for the interview and that different boards of

interview could give different marks. I now advert to the above contention. The

Petitioner was interviewed on 28.1.2008 and the 5th and 6th Respondents were

interviewed on 23.9.2008. Although the Petitioner and the 5th and 6th Respondents

were interviewed by different boards of interview, the chairman of both boards was

the same person. It is undisputed that there were three vacancies for the post of

Grama Niladhari in Welivitiya, Divithura Divisional Secretariat Division; and that

six (6) candidates should be interviewed to fill the said vacancies. Although six

candidates were selected for the interview, the 1st board of interview could not

interview one person from the above six candidates since one candidate is not from

Welivitiya, Divithura Divisional Secretariat Division. It is a requirement according

to the Gazette (P1) which advertised the post that the candidate should, within the

period of last three years from the closing date of acceptance of applications,

permanently reside in the relevant Secretariat Division. Therefore the Respondents

had to select another person for the interview who had obtained maximum marks at

SC FR 584/2008

the competitive examination. The Petitioner had obtained 132 marks at the

competitive examination and each of the 5th and 6th Respondents had obtained 131

marks at the said examination. The above information was sent by the Department

of Examination which conducted the competitive examination. Since both 5th and

6th Respondents had obtained equal marks both had to be called for the interview.

Under these circumstances the relevant officers attached to the Ministry of Public

Administration and Internal Affairs had to call both 5th and 6th Respondents for the

interview. Although learned PC for the Petitioner contended that different boards

of interview could give different marks to candidates, it appears that there is no

material to support this contention. The Petitioner had got four (4) marks for the

performance at the interview. The 5th and 6th Respondents too have got four (4)

marks for the performance at the interview. At the interview marks had been given

under various categories. At the interview the Petitioner had obtained seven (7)

marks, the 5th Respondent had obtained thirteen (13) marks and the 6th Respondent

had obtained eleven (11) marks. The above information is found in the document

marked 1R5. Thus the total marks that the Petitioner, 5th Respondent and 6th

Respondent had obtained were 139, 144 and 142 respectively. The above

information is found in the document marked 1R3. When I consider all the

aforementioned matters, I hold that the appointments of the 5th and 6th Respondents

SC FR 584/2008

had been correctly done. Therefore the Petitioner cannot complain that her

fundamental rights were violated when the 5th and 6th Respondents were selected

for the post of Grama Niladhari over and above her.

For the above reasons, I hold that the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed by

Article 12(1) of the Constitution have not been violated as alleged by the

Petitioner. For the aforementioned reasons, I dismiss the petition of the Petitioner

with costs.

Petition dismissed.
