Respondent-Respondent.

Argued & Decided on: 02.07.2019 Sisira J. de Abrew, J

Heard both counsel in support of their respective cases. This is an appeal filed against the

judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 24.04.2015 wherein he affirmed the judgment

of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal. The learned President of the Labour Tribunal

in his Judgment dated 27.03.2014 decided that the termination of services of the Applicant-

Respondent-Respondent ( hereinafter referred to as the Applicant-Respondent) is unjustified

and ordered reinstatement and ½ back wages amounting to Rs. 990,600/-. Being aggrieved by

the said judgment of the High Court, the Employer-Appellant-Appellant ( hereinafter referred

to as the Employer-Appellant) has appealed to this Court. This Court by its order dated

09.02.2016 granted leave to appeal on the questions of law set out in paragraph 13 ( a),(b) and

(e) of the affidavit dated 03.06.2015 which are set out below.

1) Was the said order of the Honourable Judge of the High Court of the UWA Province

against the weight of the evidence led at the inquiry before the Labour Tribunal ?

2) Did the Honourable Judge of the High Court fail to consider the findings of fact by

3

the Labour Tribunal that the workman had not served with the Petitioner Bank by

keeping 100% trustworthiness and honesty as required to carry out by a Bank

officer ?

3) Did the Honourable Judge of the High Court err in law with regard to burden of

proof of the Employer ?

Learned President's counsel for the Employer-Appellant at the conclusion of

submissions by both parties submitted to Court that he would confine himself to question of

law set out in paragraph 13(b) of the affidavit dated 03.06.2015. He further submitted that he

would not support the other two questions of law. He relied on the following questions of

law.

“ Did the Honourable Judge of the High Court fail to consider the findings of fact by

the Labour Tribunal that the workman had not served with the Petitioner Bank by

keeping 100% trustworthiness and honesty as required to carry out by a Bank

officer ”?

The Applicant- Respondent in this case was the Manager attached to Thanamalwila

Branch of Uva Development Bank. His services were terminated by the Bank. There were

several charges levelled against him at the domestic inquiry and he was exonerated from

charges 1 and 6 but was convicted on charges Nos. 2 to 5 and 7 to 9 . The learned President

of the Labour Tribunal in his judgment has decided that the Applicant-Respondent who was

the Manager of the said Bank had not acted with 100% honesty in dealing with affairs of the

bank.

The above conclusion reached by the learned President of the Labour Tribunal is correct when

we consider the evidence led at the trial.

Thus the most important question that must be decided is whether the Applicant- Respondent

can be reinstated in the bank especially when the learned President of the Labour

Tribunal decided that he had not acted with 100% honesty. When finding an answer to this

question, I am guided by the judgment of this Court in the case of National Savings Bank

Vs Ceylon Bank Employees Union 1982 (2) SLR page 629 at page 632. His Lordship Justice

Soza in the said judgment held as follows;

“ whether the misconduct relates to the discharge of his duties in the Bank or

not, if it reflects on the Bankman's honesty, it renders him unfit to serve in a

Bank and justifies dismissal.”

I'm also guided by the judgment of His Lordship Justice G.P.S. De Silva, CJ in the case of Bank of

Ceylon Vs Manivasagasivam 1995(2) SLR page 79. His Lordship Justice G.P.S de Silva, CJ, in the

said judgment held as follows;

“ Utmost confidence is expected of any officer employed in a Bank. There is a

duty both to the Bank to preserve its fair name an integrity and to the

customer, whose money lies in deposit with the Bank ”.

At page 83 His Lordship further held as follows;

“ It seems to be that by reason of the part played by the Applicant in two

transactions which, to say the least, were questionable, he has clearly forfeited

the confidence reposed in him as an employee of the Bank. In the

circumstances, the Bank should not and cannot continue to employ him.”

In the present case, the learned President has decided that the Applicant-

Respondent has not acted with 100% honesty when he was dealing with his duties

relating to the bank affairs.

When the learned President of the Labour Tribunal came to such conclusion, he

cannot make an order to reinstate the bank employee in the same bank with back wages.

This view is supported by the above 02 judicial decisions. The learned High Court

Judge affirmed the judgment of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal without

5

giving due consideration to above judicial decisions.

Considering all the above matters, we hold that the decision of the learned

President of the Labour Tribunal is wrong. The learned High Court Judge has also

affirmed the said Judgment of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal. In these

circumstances, we hold that both the learned President of the Labour Tribunal and the

learned High Court Judge were wrong when they came to the above conclusion.

We therefore set aside both judgments of the learned President of the Labour

Tribunal and the learned High Court Judge.

In these circumstances we hold that the termination of the Applicant-

Respondent is justified. In the circumstances we answer the above questions of law in

the affirmative.

Appeal allowed.
