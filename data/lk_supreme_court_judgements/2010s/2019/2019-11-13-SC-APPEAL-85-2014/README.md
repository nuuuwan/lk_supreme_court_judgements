S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The Accused-Appellant-Appellant, Warnakulasuriya Michael Angelo Fernando

(hereinafter referred to as the Accused-Appellant) had filed an Appeal against the

order of the High Court of Colombo, through his Power of Attorney holder,

Wanigasuriyaarachige Don Sharan Mary Dolita to the Supreme Court. Before

proceeding to address the grounds of appeal, I find it essential to produce the

material facts of the case.

The Accused-Appellant was employed as a General Cashier (Chief Cashier) at

the Hilton Hotel, Colombo. He was entrusted with many responsibilities, including

buying of Embarkation Tax Tickets from the Airport Aviation Sri Lanka Ltd.

(hereinafter referred to as AASL) for their hotel customers. Once the tickets are

obtained from AASL, the General Cashier distributes the tickets to other cashiers,

namely the Front Office, Cafeteria, Pool Cashiers, etc. It is to be noted that any

passenger who is departing through the Bandaranaike International Airport should

pay an Embarkation Tax. Many tourist hotels, including the Hilton Hotel, pre-

purchase the Embarkation Tax Tickets and provide them to their customers to have a

smooth departure at the Airport.

As a practice, the General Cashier creates necessary vouchers, seeks

permission from relevant authorities, makes the payment to AASL, obtains the ticket,

sells the same and reimburses the money, which is obtained from the cashiers

imprest.

In the present case, the Accused-Appellant who is the General Cashier had

raised necessary documents and drawn two cheques for the value of Rs. 300,000/-

each in favour of AASL and the same was sent through the travel desk of Ebert Silva

Tours, who is permanently stationed at the hotel. The said cheques were sent in a

SC Appeal No. 85/2014 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 8

sealed envelope to the agents of the hotel, stationed at Bandaranaike International

Airport. There, they open the envelope, make payments to AASL and obtain the

Embarkation Tax Tickets. In this case, the agents have obtained three books which

contained, one hundred tickets on the first occasion and similarly, on the second

occasion as well, altogether amounting to six hundred tickets, which were sent to the

Hotel in a covered parcel. There is no practice of sending these documents through

delivery books.

It is the duty of the General Cashier i.e. the Accused-Appellant, to follow up on

the purchase of the tickets, to obtain and to distribute the same to his cashiers and

further, to collect the money and reimburse it to his petty cash. It is notable that, in

2006, the petty cash of the General Cashier was Rs. 3,000,000/-.

It was found, at the routine accounts verification that, the cashier had not

accounted for the said money of Rs. 600,000/- and when they investigated, it was

found that the cashier had not reimbursed Rs. 600,000/- (i.e. 300,000 x 2), which was

used to purchase the Embarkation Tax Tickets. The Hotel held an independent

enquiry and found the Accused-Appellant guilty. Thereafter, the matter was referred

to the Colombo Fraud Investigations Bureau (hereinafter referred to as CFIB). After

formal investigation, a case was filed against the Accused-Appellant, at the Colombo-

Fort Magistrates Court on two counts under Section 391 of the Penal Code and two

alternate counts under Section 386 of the Penal Code.

A trial was held and the Prosecution led the evidence of the following

witnesses and concluded their case- 1) Sunil Chandrasiri Perera Assistant Financial

Controller, Hilton Hotel, Colombo, 2) Senerath Lal Perera Payment Officer, Hilton

Hotel 3) Anthony Ranjith Trevor Perera Restaurant Cashier, Hilton Hotel 4) Senerath

Mudalige Alexis Vineetha Jayathilake Accounts Administrator, Hilton Hotel, 5) Sarath

Premalal Perera Staff Assistant, Department of Airport and Aviation Services Ltd., 6)

Tuan Feral Ali Executive, Hilton Hotel Counter at the Bandaranaike International

Airport, 7) Jagath Udaya Kumara Mendis Tourist Driver, Ebert Silva Tours, 8) Brian

SC Appeal No. 85/2014 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 8

Christopher Pieris Manager, Transport, Ebert Silva Tours, 9) George Seneviratne

Manager, Ebert Silva Tours, 10) Salinka Dilshan Serasinghe Accountant, Ernest and

Young, 11) Ajith Neranjan Ranaweera, Banking Assistant, HSBC, 12) Police Sergeant

9255 Hewage Vijitha Kumara Ananda and 13) Anthony Jayasena Partner, Chartered

Accountant, Ernest and Young.

It is noted that, on the 14th of February 2006, the charges were explained by

the Magistrate to the Accused-Appellant and he pleaded, not guilty. He was present

throughout, till the 10th of October 2007, almost till the tail end of the case of the

Prosecution. When the case was postponed to the 5th of December 2007, he

absconded from Court. The learned Magistrate, after following necessary procedures

under the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (CCPA), continued the trial and concluded

the same. It is observed that the Attorney-at-Law continued to appear on behalf of

the accused, on his instructions.

The learned Magistrate, after giving reasons, found the Accused-Appellant

guilty on the first and the third counts and sentenced him to one year of rigorous

imprisonment for each charge, in addition to a fine of Rs. 1,500 on each count.

Further, the learned Magistrate discharged the Accused-Appellant on the second and

fourth counts.

Being aggrieved with the said order, the Accused-Appellant preferred an

appeal to the High Court. There, the learned High Court Judge, after hearing both

counsels, delivered an order affirming the conviction and the sentence of the learned

Magistrate.

Being dissatisfied with the said order of the High Court, the Accused-

Appellant preferred an appeal to the Supreme Court and obtained leave to proceed

on 10.06.2014. When the matter was taken up for argument, it was found that the

grounds of appeal were not certain and clear. Hence, the court invited the Counsels

to frame the grounds of appeal.

SC Appeal No. 85/2014 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 8

Accordingly, the following grounds of appeal were raised and are reproduced,

as it is-

1. Did the learned High Court Judge has misinterpreted the documents

marked P1 and P2 and had considered them as receipts issued by

the Petitioner in respect of the receipts of the embarkation tax

tickets?

2. Did the learned High Court Judge err in law by basing his decision on

the misconceive fact that the documents marked P1 and P2 are

proof of embarkation tax tickets being entrusted to the Petitioner?

3. Did the learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by erroneously

determining that the main ingredients in the charge of criminal

breach of trust has been established by the Prosecution beyond

reasonable doubt?

(Sic erat scriptum)

Regrettably, although both counsels agreed to file further written submissions

within 3 weeks from 20.02.2019 and a further two week period was given to respond

to each other if necessary, until the preparation of this judgment, neither of the

parties had filed their written submissions.

The learned President Counsel based his submission on the fact that there is

no proper entrustment proved by the prosecution and hence, the conviction should

fail.

In Walgamage v. The Attorney-General, 2000 3 SLR 1 SC 828, it was

observed-

Entrustment includes the delivery of property to another to be dealt

with in accordance with an arrangement made either then or

previously.

SC Appeal No. 85/2014 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 8

The Accused-Appellant had worked as a cashier at the said hotel and the

relationship between the employer and the employee is completely based on trust.

Both parties cannot rely on documents and signatures for each and every dealing.

The relationship shared between the employer and the employee is also reflected in

the entrustment of Rs. 3,000,000/- as petty cash amount to the General Cashier. In

comparison with Government Institutions, this is a large sum given to a cashier. This

shows the extent of trust that is placed on the employee for the smooth operation of

the hotel activities. Further, it is revealed that the staff was sufficiently and

adequately remunerated. A person such as the Accused-Appellant, who holds the

position of a General Cashier (Chief Cashier) should be more trustworthy and

committed to his employer, in carrying out the entrusted functions.

In Beuchanan v. Conrad, 1 SCR 38 2 CL Rep. 135, while discussing the

requirements in an offence of criminal breach of trust, it was observed-

There must be evidence of some specific sum having being

misappropriated or converted to the defendants use.

In the present case, the misappropriation of the Accused-Appellant has been

proved beyond reasonable doubt. Owing to the employer-employee relationship

shared between the Complainant and the Accused-Appellant, the finding of the

learned Magistrate that, the Accused-Appellant is guilty under Section 391 of the

Penal code is well founded.

In consideration of the grounds of appeal, it is necessary for us to peruse the

evidence led before the learned Magistrate and the arguments advanced before the

learned High Court and this Court. I am of the view that, the learned Judge of the

High Court had adequately considered the materials before him. I do not find there

to be any inconsideration of the grounds of appeal. Hence, I find that, there is no

merit in these grounds of appeal.

SC Appeal No. 85/2014 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 8

Considering the sentence, I find that, the learned magistrate has been very

reasonable in imposing the legal sentence. Therefore, I am of the view that, there

exists no reason to interfere with the findings of the learned Magistrate, regarding

the conviction of the Accused-Appellant and the sentence imposed upon him.

For the stated reasons, I find that, the learned Judge of the High Court was

correct in affirming the conviction and the sentence imposed upon the Accused-

Appellant by the learned Magistrate.

Accordingly, I dismiss the Appeal and grant no order as to costs.

Appeal dismissed.
