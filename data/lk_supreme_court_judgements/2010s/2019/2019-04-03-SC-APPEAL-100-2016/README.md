SC Appeal 100/2016

Decided on : 3.4.2019 Sisira J de Abrew J

The Plaintiff-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Plaintiff-Appellant) instituted action against the Defendant-Respondent-

Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant-Respondents)

seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the Plaintiff-Appellant is the sole owner of

the road described in the schedule to the plaint; for a declaration that the

Defendant-Respondents have no rights to use the said road; and for an order

preventing the Defendant-Respondents from using the said road. After trial the

learned District Judge by his judgment dated 4.7.2008, dismissed the plaint.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned District Judge, the Plaintiff-

Appellant appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court. The Civil Appellate High

Court by its judgment dated 26.2.2015, dismissed the appeal and entered

judgment in favour of the Defendant-Respondents permitting them (the

Defendant-Respondents) to use the road in dispute on the ground of necessity.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court, the

Plaintiff-Appellant has appealed to this court. This court by its order dated

20.5.2016 granted leave to appeal on questions of law stated in paragraphs 9(i)

to 9(iv) of the petition of appeal dated 22.3.2015 which are set out below.

1. Did the District Court and the High Court erroneously hold that the action

in D.C Horana case No.3474/L is bad in law because it was a right of

way action where the Plaintiff was obliged to establish the ownership of

the dominant tenement in order to succeed?

2. Have the District Court and the High Court failed to realize that this was a

vindicatory action in respect of Lot 5 in plan P1?

3. Has the High Court failed to realize that there was no cross appeal by the

defendants to enable them to question the findings of the learned District

Judge rejecting their claims in reconvention based on prescription and

necessity?

4. In any event has the High Court erred in holding in favour of the

defendants on the grounds of prescription and in the alternative,

necessity?

The road in dispute is shown as Lot 5 in final partition Plan No.1793 in case

No.10303/P in DC Panadura marked P1. As a result of Partition Decree (case

No.10303/P in DC Panadura) the Defendant-Respondents became the owner of

Lot 4 of the said Plan No.1793. Although the Plaintiff-Appellant became the

owner of Lot 5 of Plan No.1793 as a result of the said Partition Decree, the said

Partition Decree has not excluded the use of the road by others. There is no

access road to Lot 4 of the said Plan No.1793 other than the road in dispute

which is the Lot 5 in Plan No.1793. The Plaintiff-Appellant herself at page 116

of the brief has admitted that there was no other road to go to Lot 4 of plan No

1793 other than the disputed road.

When I consider all the above matters, I hold that the only access road to Lot 4

of the said Plan No.1793 is the disputed road which is shown as Lot 5 of the said

Plan No.1793. The Defendant-Respondents are the owners of Lot 4 of the said

Plan. Therefore I hold that the Defendant-Respondents are entitled to use the

disputed road shown as Lot 5 in Plan No 1793 on the basis of necessity.

SC Appeal 100/2016

5

For the above reasons, I hold that the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High

Court were correct when they dismissed the appeal of the Plaintiff-Appellant

and held that the Defendant-Respondents were entitled to use the disputed road.

For the above reasons, I answer the above questions of law in the negative. I

affirm the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court dated 26.2.2015 and

dismiss the appeal of the Plaintiff-Appellant with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
