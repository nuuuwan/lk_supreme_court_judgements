RESPONDENTS

Before: Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

P. Padman Surasena J

E. A. G. R. Amarasekara J

Counsel: Chamantha Weerakoon Unamboowe with O L Premaratne for the

Petitioners.

Rajiv Goonetillake SSC for the Attorney General.

Argued on : 2019 - 02 - 25

Decided on : 2019 - 09 - 25

P Padman Surasena J

The 2nd and 3rd Petitioners are respectively the president and the secretary

of the 1st Petitioner trade union. The 4th to 9th Petitioners are also members

of the said 1st Petitioner union.

11

The 2nd to 9th Petitioners are Rubber Development Officers in the Rubber

Development Department. Out of them, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and the 7th,

Petitioners had joined the Rubber Development Department in the year

1996 as Rubber Development Officers having sat for the competitive

examination held for the recruitment of officers to that post.

The 5th, 6th, 8th and the 9th Petitioners are those who had joined the Rubber

Control Department as Rubber Inspectors in the years 1983, 1985 and

1986 and were thereafter absorbed into the Rubber Development

Department.

The Rubber Development Department is the successor to the Rubber

Control Department, which had been established to exercise the powers

and functions stipulated by the Rubber Control Act No. 11 of 1956 as

amended.

The Petitioners have produced their appointment letters marked P 2(a) to

P 2(h). They state that all the Petitioners were recruited in terms of the

same scheme of recruitment. The said scheme of recruitment containing

the recruitment procedures to grades II, I and a special grade has been

produced marled P 5(a), P 5(b), and P 5(c) respectively.

12

In the year 1994, the Rubber Control Department and the Advisory

Services Department of the Rubber Research Board were amalgamated by

integrating all functional services of the Advisory Services Department of

the Rubber Research Board into the Rubber Control Department. This had

been done pursuant to a Cabinet decision produced marked P 6(a) and P

6(b).

As the Rubber Control Department had ceased to exist with the

establishment of the Rubber Development Department, the Petitioners had

become employees of the newly established Rubber Development

Department with effect from 1st July 1994, and their designations were

changed to Rubber Development Officer Grade II. The Petitioners have

produced marked P 7, the letter issued to the 9th Petitioner informing him

of his changed designation.

As per the Cabinet decision (P 6(a) and P 6(b)) Extension Officers of the

Advisory Services Department of the Rubber Research Board were also

given the option of joining the Rubber Development Department as

Rubber Development Officers. It is the complaint of the Petitioners that

the said Extension Officers were subsequently placed under a salary scale

higher than the Petitioners consequent to a judgment pronounced by this

13

Court in the case SC FR 961/97. It appears that those Extension Officers

as per the said Cabinet decision are entitled to enjoy the salary and the

other benefits as their counterparts in the Rubber Research Board to which

they had originally joined.

In terms of the Public Administrations Circular No. 06/2006 (produced

marked P 9) the Rubber Development Officers were placed in MN-1 Step 6

in the said circular.

Subsequently, upon representations being made by the Petitioners to the

1st Respondent who in turn made representations to the relevant Ministry

and also to the National Salaries and Cadre Commission, Rubber

Development Officers who were in Grade II were placed at MT-2, Step 6

while Rubber Development Officers who were in Grade I were placed at

MT-2, Step 23.

The 1st Respondent by the newspaper advertisement dated 15-03-2015

produced marked P 17, had called for applications from persons with

qualifications specified therein, for the post of Rubber Development

Officers in the Rubber Development Department under a new scheme of

recruitment approved by the Public Service Commission on 14-11-2014

produced marked P 18. According to the said new scheme of recruitment

14

the Petitioners have been placed in the category identified as Supervisory

Management Assistant - Technical with the applicable salary code being

MN 3 - 2006 A. the said circular has taken away the requirement of a

degree as the threshold qualification. Said circular also has introduced a

new grade called grade III as the recruitment grade.

Petitioners complain that the requirement of a degree as a threshold

qualification had been deliberately taken away to justify the placement of

the Petitioners in salary code MN 3 - 2006 A. Petitioners state that the said

removal of the requirement of a degree as a threshold qualification for

recruitment has resulted in making their post qualitatively inferior and had

lowered their status. Petitioners claim that the categorization of the

Petitioners as Supervisory Management - Technical is arbitrary,

unreasonable and without any basis. Petitioners claim that in terms of the

Public Administrations Circular 06/2006, their service category according to

their qualifications and functions should be the category called Field/Office

Based Officers itemized at 3.7.2 of the said circular and that accordingly

they should be placed on the salary code MN 5 - 2006 A.

It is on the above basis that the Petitioners state that the scheme of

recruitment approved by the Public Service Commission on 14-11-2014 (P

15

18) is unfair, unreasonable, discriminatory and arbitrary. Accordingly, it is

their claim that the said circular has violated their fundamental rights

guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 14 1(g) of the Constitution.

It is on that basis that the Petitioners in this application have prayed inter

alia, for following relief.

I. A declaration that the Respondents have infringed the fundamental

rights of the Petitioners and those whom they represent, guaranteed

under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution,

II. A declaration that the new scheme of recruitment approved by the

Public Service Commission on 2014-11-14 is invalid and / void and

inoperative,

III. A direction to the Respondents to place the Petitioners and Rubber

Development Officers in a service category and salary code

commensurate with their existing qualifications and functions.

This Court on 05-10-2015 having heard the submissions of the learned

counsel for the Petitioner and the submissions of the learned Deputy

Solicitor General for the Respondents had decided to grant leave to

proceed in respect of the alleged violations of Articles 12(1) and 14(1) (g)

of the Constitution.

16

The 1st Respondent in his affidavit has taken up the following positions.

1. It had taken over 7 years to finalize the impugned circular, as there

were consultations, negotiations and discussions with the Petitioners

from time to time. It is his position that what the Petitioners are

seeking to challenge in the instant application is the new scheme of

recruitment approved by the Public Service Commission on 14-11-

2014 produced marked P 18, which is the outcome of the said

consultations, negotiations and discussions.

2. Although the crux of the Petitioners objection to the new scheme of

recruitment is the removal of the degree as one of the alternate

qualifications for recruitment, none of the 9 Petitioners of this

application and 42 persons who are said to be similarly

circumstanced as the Petitioners, were not graduates at the time of

their recruitment. It is his position that few of them had subsequently

obtained degrees while serving in the department.

Learned Senior State Counsel in addition to his arguments based on the

merits of the case also raised the issue that the Petitioners have failed to

file this application within the time frame specified by law.

17

In contradistinction to the above claim by the Respondents, the Petitioners

have taken up the position that it was only when the newspaper

advertisement was published on 15-03-2015 (P 17), they became aware

that a new scheme of recruitment (P 18) has been approved by the Public

Service Commission on 14-11-2014.

Thus, the first issue that this Court has to resolve is whether the

Petitioners application is out of time.

In order to ascertain whether the Petitioners application is out of time, it

would be opportune at this juncture to apply the principles laid down in the

judgment of His Lordship Justice Prasanna Jayawardena PC in the case of

Demuni Sriyani de Zoysa and others Vs Chairman, Public Service Commission

and others. 1

When applying the aforesaid principles, one has to sequentially ask the

following questions:

(i) (a) When did the alleged infringement occur?; or, if Petitioners claim

they became aware of the alleged infringement only sometime after

1 SC FR 206 / 2008 decided on 09-12-2016.

18

it occurred, when did they become aware of it or when should they

have become aware if it?

(b) If the alleged infringement is in the nature of a continuing one

which the Petitioners were aware of, till when did it continue?;

(ii) If the application has been filed more than one month after the latest

date determined when considering (a) and (b) above, have the

Petitioners established that, they were unable to invoke the jurisdiction

of this Court due to circumstances, which were beyond their control

and that, there has been no lapse, fault or delay on their part?

(iii) If so, have the Petitioners filed this application within one month of

any such disability ending?

As has been held in that judgment, the date determined in answer to the

first subset of questions will determine the date on which the one month

period stipulated in Article 126 (2) commences to run. Quite obviously, if the

petition has been filed within one month of that date, it is within time.

As has been stated before, the Petitioners are seeking to challenge in the

instant application the new scheme of recruitment (P 18) which the Public

Service Commission had approved on 14-11-2014. Thus, it is clear that the

alleged infringement of the fundamental rights of the Petitioners had

19

occurred on 14-11-2014. However, the Petitioners have filed the instant

application on 30-03-2015.

As the Petitioners claim that they became aware of the alleged

infringement only when the newspaper advertisement (P 17) was

published on 15-03-2015, this Court needs to ascertain next, as to when

had the Petitioners indeed become aware of it or when should they have

become aware if it?

The document produced by the 1st Respondent marked 1 R 4 , annexed to

his affidavit dated 08-07-2015 shows clearly that the Petitioners had

discussed with the 1st Respondent the possibility of making amendments to

the approved new scheme of recruitment. This discussion had taken place

on 25-11-2014 and the main aim of the Petitioners during the said

discussion had been an attempt to place them on the salary code MN 5.

The contents of the letter dated 08-12-2014 (1 R 4) shows clearly that the

1st Respondent had taken whatever measures possible within his means to

support the attempts of the Petitioners. This is further buttressed by the

fact that the said letter has been copied to the Secretary of the 1st

Petitioner association for its notice. The Petitioners in their joint counter

20

affidavit have denied being sent a copy of the said letter.2 This Court while

observing that the above denial is a mere statement in their counter

affidavit, also observes that the Petitioners have indeed admitted that they

had held the discussion on 25-11-2014 described in the said letter dated

08-12-2014 (1 R 4). The contents of paragraph 6 of the counter affidavit

filed by the Petitioners are clearly against the 1st Respondent with an

allegation that a wrong SOR was shown to them. In other words, what the

Petitioners have stated is that the 1st Respondent had suppressed from

them, the new SOR and misled them. However, this Court decides to reject

the Petitioners above position as the 1st Respondent had done everything

within his means to support the attempts of the Petitioners. Thus, this

Court sees no reason as to why the 1st Respondent should have acted in

the way alleged by the Petitioners.

Therefore, this Court rejects the position taken up by the Petitioners that

they became aware of the alleged infringement only when the newspaper

advertisement (P 17) was published on 15-03-2015.

The upshot of the above conclusion is that the Petitioners have failed to file

the instant application within one-month time period specified in Article

2 Paragraph 6 of the counter affidavit dated 07-08-2015.

21

126 (2) of the Constitution. For those reasons, this Court decides to

uphold the issue raised by the learned Senior State Counsel that the

Petitioners have failed to file this application within the time frame

specified by law.

Therefore, this Court decides to dismiss this application without costs.
