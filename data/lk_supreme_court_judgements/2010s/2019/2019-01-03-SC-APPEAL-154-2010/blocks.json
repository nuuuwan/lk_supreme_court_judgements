As the matter was re-argued before the present bench, I do not wish to refer to the judgment delivered by this court in the matter on 12.05.2011. The Accused-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cAccused\u201d) was indicted before the High Court under Section 54A(d) of the Opium, Poisons and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance for being in possession of 9.91 grams of Heroin. The learned Judge of the High Court convicted the Accused and aggrieved by the judgment the accused appealed to the Court of Appeal and by its judgment dated 04-05-2010 the court set aside the judgment of the High Court and acquitted the accused. It was against the said judgment that the Hon. Attorney-General moved this court by way of Special Leave to Appeal. The facts, albeit briefly are as follows: On 27th-January 2000, at dawn, a team of police officers attached to Habaraduwa Police Station led by Sub Inspector Jayamanne was patrolling the area of Unawatuna. Evidence of Sub Inspector Jayamanne was that he received a tip-off from an informant about the accused who was said to have been in possession of Heroin. The information received by Sub Inspector Jayamanne also revealed the location of the accused and Sub Inspector Jayamanne along with Sergeant Punchihewa had proceeded to the given location of the accused, having stationed the other police officers of his team at various points to prevent the Accused escaping in the event the information was correct. As anticipated the Accused had taken to his heels and Sergeant Punchihewa had managed to apprehend the suspect having given chase. Upon being searched, the police had recovered a parcel from a pocket of the pair of shorts the accused was wearing at the time. The parcel had contained a powder which had weighed 18.6 grams and the Government Analyst had identified 9.91 grams of pure Heroin in that powder. This evidence was presented before the Court by the prosecution and the accused made a dock statement admitting the arrest by the Police Officers but denied he had a parcel",

    "text": "containing heroin in his pocket. The learned High Court Judge found the Accused guilty and having proceeded to convict the Accused, imposed life imprisonment on him. At the hearing of this appeal, on behalf of the State, the learned ASG strenuously argued that their Lordships of the Court of Appeal in deciding to set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed on the accused, erred when their Lordships held that \u201cit is difficult to understand how a trial judge could be satisfied with the evidence of only one of the main witnesses who really took part in the arrest of the accused, especially in drug related offences where police officers are the key witnesses\u201d. It was the contention of the learned Additional Solicitor General that in holding so their Lordships lost sight of a fundamental principle of evidence, that is, \u201cevidence is to be weighed and not counted\u201d. The learned ASG argued that in evaluating evidence of the witnesses, a trial judge is entitled to reject the evidence of a witness or witnesses as the case may be, if he is of the opinion that they are not creditworthy and at the same time, is entitled to act on the evidence of a single witness if in the opinion of the judge, the evidence is credible. The learned ASG went on to argue that this principle is part of our law of evidence and Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance explicitly lays down that \u201cno particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact\u201d. The learned ASG submitted that the observation of the Court of Appeal; \u201c [\u2026] how a trial judge could be satisfied with the evidence of only one main witness who really took part in the arrest [\u2026] , is obnoxious to the evidentiary provision referred to above. It was the contention of the learned ASG that the observation of the Court of Appeal referred to above, places an additional burden on the prosecution to corroborate the evidence of a Police Officer who conducts a raid in a drug related offence, in order to secure a conviction. In fairness, it must be stated that their Lordships of the Court of Appeal had referred to the principle that there is no necessity for a party to summon more than one witness to prove a fact. Their Lordships also had been mindful of the fact that, what matters is \u201cnot the quantity or the volume but the quality of the evidence\u201d, the principle laid down in Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance.",

It is only then the defence will have the opportunity to challenge the veracity or the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and thus contradict the prosecution version. More than corroboration I am concerned about the fact that the defence should be provided with the opportunity to contradict the witnesses. To obtain Contradictions interse is the only way out for an innocent accused. To mark contradictions per se, where trained and experienced government officials such as police Officers give evidence, is seemingly impossible and is a task next to impossibility in view of the fact that an official conducting a raid is more often than not is resourceful in strategy and inevitably an experienced officer with a lot of ingenuity and cunning.\u201d I shall now deal with the issue as to the reasoning, as it appears to me, for their Lordships to hold that corroboration is required to convict an accused in instances where the raid is conducted by trained officers. In the present case, as far as the facts are concerned, the evidence is that it was Reserve Police constable 18123 Punchihewa and SI, Jayamanne who gave chase to the accused when he was fleeing. It is also in evidence that it was P.C. Punchihewa who managed to catch up with the Accused first and apprehend him. According to the evidence of S.I. Jayamanne, he had received information about the location of the Accused while they were out on duty and when he approached the place, he had seen the Accused seated under a Kithul tree and as",

The witness also had reached them almost immediately after and had brought the Accused under control. The witness had then searched the accused and had retrieved five packets wrapped in Polythene from the pocket of the pair of shorts the Accused was attired at the time. The packets had contained a brown coloured powder. The witness had said in his evidence that from the texture and the smell, he identified the powder as heroine. The Accused had then been taken to the police vehicle that had been parked a short distance away and had brought the Accused to the police station to attend to the other formalities relating to the detection. During the course of the trial, the prosecution as stated above led the evidence of S.I. Jayamanne (who held the rank of Inspector of Police at the time he testified before the High Court) but the prosecution, however, did not lead the evidence of P.C. Punchihewa who is said to have caught up with the accused first when he fled. In addition to S.I. Jayamanne, the prosecutor also had led the evidence of P. C. Ranasinghe, another member of the team, which arrested the accused and he had been stationed with two other officers at another location, with instructions to apprehend the suspect, had he come in their direction while fleeing. After being so stationed, about 1 \u00bd hours to 2 hours later S.I. Jayamanne had informed them to come to the location where the police vehicle was parked. It appears that S.I. Jayamanne and P.C.

    "text": "\u201cOn a consideration of the relevant authorities and the provisions of the IEA 1872, the following propositions may be safely stated as firmly established: (1) As a general rule, a court can and may act on the testimony of a single witness though uncorroborated. One credible witness outweighs the testimony of a number of other witnesses of indifferent character. (2) Unless corroboration is insisted upon by statute courts should not insist on corroboration except in cases where the nature of the testimony of the single witness itself requires as a rule of prudence, that corroboration should be insisted upon, for example, in the case of a child witness whose evidence is that of an accomplice or of an analogous character. (Emphasis is mine) (3) Whether corroboration of the testimony of a single witness is or is not necessary, must depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and no general rule can be laid down in a matter like this and much depends upon the judicial discretion of the judge before whom the case comes. In view of these considerations, we have no hesitation in holding that the contention that in a murder case, the court should insist upon a plurality of witnesses, is much too broadly stated. Section 134 of the Indian Evidence, has categorically laid it down that \u201eno particular number of witnesses shall, in any case, be required for the proof of any fact\u201f. The Legislature determined, as long ago as 1872, presumably after due consideration of the pros and cons, that it shall not be necessary for proof or disproof of a fact, to call any particular number of witnesses.\u201d In the instant case the State Counsel may have decided against calling P.C. Punchihewa to testify during the trial to avert duplication of evidence and also to save time of the court as examination of Punchihewa would not have achieved any material purpose for the reason that both S.I. Jayamanne and P.C Punchihewa had reached the Accused within a few seconds of each other. On the other hand, P.C. Punchihewa could not have added anything additional to the",

Hence, in the absence of any other infirmities, having considered all these matters, if the trial judge forms the opinion that the witness is credible, I do not think the trial judge has any other option other than to accept the evidence and to act on it. Hypothetically, if the rationale of their lordships of the Court of Appeal expounded in this case is applied, when a single Police officer whilst on duty acts on a tip off that a person is engaged in an illegal activity, takes action and apprehends the person so engaged in the illegal activity with a prohibited substance, no prosecution can be brought about against the person who was engaged in the said illegal activity, as there would be no other witness to corroborate the police officer who made the detection. R Vs. Arnough (1973) 21 WIR CA of Jamaica is a classic case that falls in to the scenario referred to.",

    "text": "A Police Officer asked a third party to obtain some cannabis for him. The third party arranged for the accused to deliver it to the officer at a later date. When he did so, he was charged with a number of offences (relating to the prohibited substance). The accused claimed that the officer by soliciting the offence, became an accomplice, whose evidence required corroboration. It was held that although the officer may have acted illegally, he was no accomplice. The court held that his evidence was admissible and did not require corroboration. As such, I hold that the Court of Appeal erred when the Court of Appeal said that \u201cit is difficult to understand how the trial judge could be satisfied with the evidence of only one witness.\u201d The second issue that this court is called upon to address is whether corroboration is mandatory to establish an offence based on a detection, resulting from a police raid. The Jamaican case Arnough (supra) again is the proposition, that corroboration is not a sine qua non relating to police detections. Lyris Silva Vs. Karunaratne 48 NLR 310 was a case where a Price Control Inspector induced one of his colleagues to act as a decoy. The decoy was given a rupee note and went to the bakery of the accused and asked for a pound loaf of bread. The decoy\u201fs version was, the accused gave him a loaf and after taking the rupee note, gave him 65 cents change when the control price of a loaf of bread was 25 cents. There was no corroboration of this statement of the decoy by any of the other witnesses. The rest of the raiding party came up later and found the loaf and the 65 cents in the decoy\u201fs possession. The accused took up the position that he gave 75 cents in change to the decoy not sixty-five cents as claimed by the decoy. The questions that came up before the court were, whether the decoy was an accomplice, and if he was an accomplice, whether his evidence on the material points as to whether the decoy was given 75 cents or 65 cents, has been corroborated by independent evidence.",

    "text": "Delivering the decision, Dias J stated that \u201cI am of opinion that in this case the witness (decoy) cannot be regarded as an accomplice. While his evidence does not need corroboration nevertheless, it must be probed and accepted with great caution\u201d. I see some similarities in the case of Lyris Silva (supra) and the present case. According to the evidence after the accused was arrested, five packets containing a powder are alleged to have been recovered from the Accused. These five packets were later submitted to the Government Analyst and upon its analysis and return, were produced in Court. The evidence was that the powder contained almost 10 grams (9.91) of pure Heroine, which, to my mind, is a substantial quantity of the illegal drug. Considering the above, I answer the second question also in the affirmative and hold that corroboration is not mandatory to establish a charge based on a police detection if the evidence, after probing closely, is acceptable to the judge. The third question that this court is called upon to answer is whether in cases of this nature, whether the prosecution has a duty towards the accused to provid him with an opportunity to contradict (inter-se) the prosecution witnesses. The learned ASG took serious objection to the following passage of the impugned judgement of the Court of Appeal. Their Lordships stated that:",
