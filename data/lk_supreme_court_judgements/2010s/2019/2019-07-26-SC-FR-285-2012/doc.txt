WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS : Respondents on 28th June 2019. DECIDED ON : 26th July 2019

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The Petitioners have filed this Application alleging that their fundamental rights

guranteed by Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) have been violated by the Respondents.

The brief facts of the case, in the chronological order are as stated below.

All Island Agriculture Monitoring Officers Union i.e. the 23rd Petitioner is a duly registered

Trade Union and has made this application on behalf of its members i.e. the 1st to 22nd

Petitioners (hereinafter collectively referred to as the ‘Petitioners’). The Petitioners are

employed as Agricultural Monitoring Officers under the Ministry of Agriculture and hold

bachelor’s degree in science/agriculture and some of them hold a master’s degree in

science.

The 1st, 3rd and 4th Petitioners, in terms of a cabinet decision in 1994, were inducted into

the Department of Agriculture as ‘Graduate Trainees’ on a probationary basis between

1994-1995 and 1995-1996. After two to three years of training, the said Petitioners were

absorbed into the Department of Agriculture as ‘Research Assistants’ (in Sri Lanka

Technical Service) to the permanent cadre on or about 15.01.1998. Simultaneous to the

recruitment/appointment of ‘Research Assistants’, the Department of Agriculture also

recruited/appointed ‘Economic Assistants’, for which the eligibility criteria was a Degree

in Arts with Economics being offered as a subject.

The 2nd Petitioner and the 5th to 22nd Petitioners were recruited in 1999 under the

Graduate Trainees Scheme and later, some of the graduates were confirmed as ‘Graduate

Agricultural Development Officers’ in the year 2000. Thereafter, the 1st, 3rd and 4th

SC/ FR/ 285/2012 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 15

Petitioners along with several others filed an application bearing No. SC (FR) 528/2000,

alleging that their fundamental rights had been violated and that they be appointed to

the post of ‘Graduate Agricultural Development Officers’. Subsequently, the said

Petitioners were appointed to the said post of ‘Graduate Agricultural Development

Officers’. Later, the Petitioners were assigned a new designation as ‘Agriculture

Monitoring Officer’, which was approved with effect from 04.03.2004.

By virtue of discussions that ensued between the Petitioners and the then Minister and

Secretary of Agriculture regarding the non-implementation of Recruitment and

Promotional Schemes, a Cabinet Memorandum bearing No 1452 dated 21.10.2004

(marked as ‘P-14’) was submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers for the creation of a new

Recruitment and Promotional Scheme for Agricultural Monitoring Officers.

On 01.11.2004, the cabinet sub-committee on establishment matters decided that the

proposal in the said Cabinet Memorandum be referred to the Department of

Management Services for examination and report. The Department of Management

Services did not recommend the proposed salary scale for Agriculture Monitoring Officers

and proposed an alternative grading system on the existing salary scale for Agriculture

Monitoring Officers. (marked as ‘P-15’). Thereafter, the Cabinet Memorandum was

approved on 06.01.2005.

Pursuant to the above events, the then Director General of Agriculture, on account of

representations made by some of the Petitioners before the Secretary, Ministry of

Agriculture, issued a recruitment/promotion scheme for Agriculture Monitoring Officers

[marked as ‘P-17(b)’] in terms of letter dated 15.02.2005 [marked as ‘P-17(a)’].

The then Deputy Director of Agriculture addressed a letter dated 28.02.2006 to the

Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, stating that the holding of the efficiency bar

examination was delayed since the Scheme of Recruitment had not been approved.

Thereafter, the 23rd Petitioner filed a case bearing no. SC (FR) 61/2006 alleging that the

SC/ FR/ 285/2012 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 15

rights of its members have been violated since their promotional prospects were being

affected. The proceedings of the application were terminated since the parties arrived at

a settlement and a new Service Minute was drafted.

On the issuance of Public Administration Circular No. 06 of 2006, the Petitioners were

placed in the salary scale of MN-4. The Petitioners objected to being placed in the said

salary scale of MN-4, while Economic Assistants were placed in the salary scale of MN-6

(which is two grades higher than the salary scale of the Petitioners). Thereafter, the

Petitioners made an application bearing SC (FR) No. 474/2009 seeking that they be placed

in the salary scale of MN-6 and when the matter came up for support, leave was refused.

Thereafter, the Service Minute of the Sri Lanka Agriculture Service was amended by

Gazette notification bearing no. 1619/25, (marked as ‘P28’) enabling the Petitioners to sit

for a limited competitive examination, with view to entering a named Public Service with

promotional prospects. The Petitioners were not in agreement with the purported criteria,

speculated in P28 for the determination of their seniority and the Petitioners claim that

they had filed an FR Application, in this regard, for which leave to proceed was refused.

Thereafter, the Minute of the Programme Officers’ Service (hereinafter referred to as the

‘Service Minute’) dated 14.02.2012 was published in the Gazette-Extra Ordinary bearing

No. 1745/11 (marked as ‘P-30’). Clause 14 of the said Minute provides that officers who

had been recruited under different designations in line with the government policy of

providing employment for the unemployed graduates from 1994 till the date of

implementation of the service minute i.e. 01.08.2011 and are in the salary scale MN 4-

2006(A) were entitled to be absorbed as Programme Officers in accordance with the

provisions laid down in Clause 14. In order to give effect to the said Clause 14, Public

Administration (PA) Circular No. 10/2012 (hereinafter referred to as ‘PA Circular’) dated

08.05.2012 (marked as ‘P-33’) was issued.

SC/ FR/ 285/2012 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 15

The Petitioners have filed the present application before this Court alleging that their

fundamental rights under Article 12(1) has been violated by the Service Minute (marked

as ‘P30’) and the PA Circular (marked as ‘P33’) relating to the implementation of the said

service minute. On 12.07.2012, leave was granted to proceed on the alleged infringement

of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Having referred to the facts of this application as submitted by the learned Counsel for

the Petitioners and agreed to by the learned Counsel for the Respondents, I now turn to

consider the grievance of the Petitioners and the corresponding contentions of the

Respondents.

In the present application, the Petitioners, inter alia, have prayed that the Court declare

the Service Minute (marked as ‘P30’) and the PA circular (marked as ‘P33’) relating to the

implementation of the said service minute null and void. The contention of the Petitioners

vis-à-vis the said Service Minute and PA Circular is two-fold-

Firstly, according to the Petitioners, as stated in Paragraph 39 of the Petition dated

07.06.2012, in the event that they are absorbed to the Program Officers’ Service in terms

of the Service Minute, inter alia, their designations would change and they would not be

eligible to sit for the aforementioned limited competitive examination.

I find that, Paragraph 17.2 of the Service Minute (marked as ‘P30’) provides that officers

who do not elect to be absorbed to the Programme Officers’ Service can continue to serve

in their respective posts, thereby imposing no mandatory absorption into that service, on

the Petitioners. Therefore, the Petitioners have the option to sit for the limited competitive

examination by remaining in their respective posts.

Secondly, according to the Petitioners, in the event that they choose not to be absorbed,

there exists the possibility of a transfer with a change in their designations and they would

then not be eligible to sit for the limited competitive exam, as a result of which they would

SC/ FR/ 285/2012 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 15

not be eligible for promotions. The Petitioners have on the contrary, also stated in

paragraph 44 of the Petition dated 07.06.2012 that, if they were to remain in their present

posts without a transfer, they would be affected since there exists no scheme of

recruitment for them in relation to their present posts

In response to the above contention, in the affidavit of the 3rd Respondnet dated

24.11.2014, it has been stated in paragraph 31 that, promotions can be granted for officers

who are not willing to be absorbed into the Programme Officers’ Service once a scheme

of recruitment is approved. Therefore, I find that, efforts are in place to facilitate

promotions in the event that the petitioners choose not to be absorbed into the

Programme Officers’ Service.

The Petitioners, in furtherance of their contentions, had stated in paragraph 46 of the

Petition dated 07.06.2012, that, the said Service Minute (marked as ‘P30’) and PA Circular

(marked as ‘P33’) are inter alia arbitrary and in violation of the Petitioners’ rights under

Article 12(1). I find it crucial to properly provide the meaning of arbitrariness with regard

to the principles enumerated in Article 12(1). The concept of arbitrariness under Article 14

of the Indian Constitution, which is the equivalent of Article 12(1), has been interpreted in

several decisions.

In the case of Sharma Transport v. Government of A.P. (2002) 2 SCC 188, it was

observed-

“The expression ‘arbitrarily’ means: in an unreasonable manner, as

fixed or done capriciously or at pleasure, without adequate determining

principle, not founded in the nature of things, non-rational, not done or

acting according to reason or judgment, depending on the will alone.”

(Emphasis added)

SC/ FR/ 285/2012 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 15

In the case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248, it was observed-

“The principle of reasonableness, which legally and philosophically, is an

essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like

a brooding omnipresence.”

The above view was re-iterated in the case of R.D. Shetty v. International Airport

Authority, (1979) 3 SCC 489-

“The principle of reasonableness and rationality which is legally as well as

philosophically an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness is

protected by Article 14 and it must characterise every State action, whether

it be under authority of law or in exercise of executive power without

making of law.”

Therefore, deducing the interpretation from the above cases, it is clear that

reasonableness is an essential element of non-arbitrariness or in other words, an arbitrary

action lacks reasonableness.

In the case of Perera v. Monetary Board of the Central Bank and Ors. (1994) 1 Sri L.R

152, with regard to promotion/recruitment in the public sector, it was observed that-

“Persons are entitled to complain … if they were invidiously or arbitrarily

treated by or in the selection process”

In the present case, the absorption into the Programme Officers’ Service, in terms of the

Service Minute (marked as ‘P30’) and the PA Circular (marked as ‘P33’) is at the option of

the Petitioners. The absence of a mandatory imposition of absorption makes the said

Service Minute and the PA Circular reasonable. On account of the presence of

reasonableness, I find that the terms and conditions set out in the said Service Minute

(marked as ‘P30’) and PA Circular (marked as ‘P33’) are not arbitrary and not violative of

Article 12(1) of the constitution.

SC/ FR/ 285/2012 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 15

In addition to the above, I find it pertinent to make the following observations.

I find that that the Petitioners have, since their recruitment, filed at least three FR

applications prior to the present application before us, namely, SC (FR) 528/2000, which

resulted in their appointment to the post of ‘Graduate Agricultural Development Officers’;

SC (FR) 61/2006, on account of which they arrived at a settlement for a new service minute

to be drafted and SC (FR) No. 474/2009, seeking that they be placed in the salary scale of

MN-6, for which leave was refused when the matter came up for support.

In the present application before us, the Petitioners, in clause (e) of the Prayer in the

Petition dated 07.06.2012, had pleaded that the Court direct the Respondents to place

the Petitioners in an appropriate salary scale commensurate with their qualifications and

their service. With regard to the said relief sought in clause (e), I am of the view that, the

petitioners have already invoked the Jurisdiction of this Court in SC (FR) No. 474/2009, for

which leave was refused, as enumerated above. Therefore, I find that the Petitioners are

estopped from seeking the same relief from this Court.

Moreover, the Petitioners, while alleging that their fundamental right under Article 12(1)

had been violated, had stated in paragraph 46(e) of the Petition dated 07.06.2012, that,

the Petitioners being degree holders were placed in the salary scale of MN-4 whereas

Diploma holders attached to the Technical Service have been placed in the salary scale of

MN-3. The Petitioners had also stated in paragraph 27 of the Petition dated 07.06.2012,

that, ‘Economic Assistants’ who joined under the Graduate Scheme along with the

Petitioners have been placed in the salary scale of MN-6. I find that, these contentions are

baseless for the following reasons.

The Diploma holders attached to the Technical Service have been placed in a salary scale

of MN-3, which in any case, is below the salary scale of the Petitioners. In Page 7 of the

written submissions on behalf of the Respondents, it has been submitted that the

‘Economic Assistants’ had been recruited in terms of the Sri Lanka Technical Service

SC/ FR/ 285/2012 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 15

Minute after a competitive recruitment procedure while the Petitioners were not recruited

on a competitive examination but on the basis of a Cabinet Decision to recruit

unemployed graduates.

I am of the view that, the Petitioners have not made out that they have been treated

differently from persons similarly placed but have rather contended that they be given

similar treatment as provided to those who belong to a different class/category.

Therefore, I find that, there exists no differential treatment.

I find that, there is no violation of the fundamental right of the Petitioners under Article

12(1), for the reasons already enumerated by me.

Accordingly, I dismiss the Application and order the Petitioners to pay a cost of Rs.

10,000/- each to the Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture.

Application dismissed.
