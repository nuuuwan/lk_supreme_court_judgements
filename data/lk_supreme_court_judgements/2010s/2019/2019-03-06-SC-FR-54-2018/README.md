The Petitioner in this application alleges that her fundamental rights guaranteed by

Article 12(1) of the Constitution were violated by the Respondents when they

failed to admit her child to Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya, Colombo. This court

by its order dated 26.3.2018 granted leave to proceed for alleged violation of

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

The Petitioner states in her petition that she and her sister live in the house located

at No.23/F/1/3, E.D Dabare Mawatha, Naraheinpita; that all seven members of the

Petitioners family including their mother live in upstairs of the said house. The

3

owner of the house is the mother of the Petitioner. The Petitioner complains that

her sisters child who was living in the same house was admitted to Sirimavo

Bandaranaike Vidyalaya but her child was not admitted. The most important

question that should be decided in this case is whether the Petitioner lives in the

said house. The Petitioner in order to establish this matter has produced several

documents including bank books and electoral registers. It is not necessary to refer

to the said documents one by one. The Principal of Sirimavo Bandaranaike

Vidyalaya, the 1st Respondent, rejected the admission of the Petitioners child on

the basis that the Petitioner does not live in the said house. The 1st Respondent has

produced the Inspection Reports marked 1R3, 1R4 and 1R5. Learned PC for the

Petitioner contended that the said reports should not be considered as the people

who inspected the house had not filed affidavits. He further contended that the

document marked 1R3 dated 24.10.2017 and 1R4 dated 31.10.2017 should not be

considered as they relate to the Petitioners sisters child. In my view even if they

relate to the Petitioners sisters child if the Petitioner was living in the said house

as at 24.10.2017 and 31.10.2017, they become relevant. The date of 1R5 is

12.12.2017. The learned SSC who appeared for the Respondents admitted before

us that the person who inspected the house (Principal Isipathana Vidyalaya) had,

by mistake, stated the date as 12.12.2017 in 1R5 but it should be corrected as

23.12.2017. Learned PC however relying on the sad mistake contended that the

said document should be rejected. The documents referred to above have been

produced by the Principal Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya along with her

affidavit. When I consider all the above material, there is no reason for me to reject

the said documents.

On 24.10.2017, when two people (Illangakoon and Gunasekara) went to inspect

the said house, the Petitioner and her sister had not been present in the house.

4

However little later they came to the house. The two inspectors (Illangakoon and

Gunasekara) have made observations in the document marked 1R3 that the

Petitioners sister was living in the downstairs of the said house. When the said

inspectors made inquiries from the Petitioner regarding the place where she was

living she (the Petitioner) had replied she was living in upstairs of the house. She

has further said that she could not show inside of upstairs since her mother had

gone away taking the keys of the upstairs of the house. The question that arises is

as to why her mother took away the keys of the living section of the house if she

(the Petitioner) was living in the said section of the house. The time of the

inspection was 7.45 a.m.

On 31.10.2017, when two inspectors (Illangakoon and Gunasekara) visited the

house they had found that the Petitioners sister, her mother and her children were

living in the downstairs of the house. When they made inquiries about the

residence of the Petitioner, the sister of the Petitioner informed them that younger

sister of the Petitioner had gone away with the keys of the upstairs of the house and

as such the upstairs of the house could not be examined. The Petitioner was not

present in the house on this day.

On 23.12.2017 Premasisri Epa who is the Principal of Isipathana Vidyalaya and

one Kapila Prasanna on behalf of Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya visited the

said house again. But they did not meet the Petitioner in this house. On this day

they had the opportunity of visiting the upstairs of the house. According to their

observation brooms and some plastic items had been stored in the upstairs of this

house. Although the Petitioner had claimed that she and her family live in the

upstairs of this house, they did not find clothes, books, school bags and shoes of

the children. However they observed that the Petitioners sister and children were

5

living in downstairs of this house. Even Illangakoon and Gunasekara had made the

same observation regarding the downstairs of the house. However the Petitioner

along with her counter objections has produced photographs to show that there

were certain items such as a bed, a fan and an iron in the upstairs of this house.

When I consider all the aforementioned matters, I feel that these photographs had

been taken for the purpose of filing the case.

When I consider all the aforementioned matters, it is not possible to conclude that

the Petitioner and her family live in the upstairs of the said house. In my view the

Petitioner has failed to establish that she and her family live in the upstairs of this

house. For the above reasons, I hold that the decision of the 1st Respondents not to

admit Petitioners child to Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya is correct and that the

Petitioners fundamental rights have not been violated by the Respondents. For the

above reasons, I dismiss the petition of the Petitioner with costs.

Petition dismissed.
