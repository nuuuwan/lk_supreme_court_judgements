SC /FR/621/2010

This Court by its order dated 13.12.2010, granted leave to proceed for the

alleged violations of fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the

Constitution of the Republic. This Court also granted an interim order as prayed

for in paragraph (g) of the prayer to the petition preventing the 9th (Royal

Institute) from constructing illegal and unauthorized buildings. The petitioners,

inter alia, complain the following matters.

1. The petitioners reside and/or in close proximity to Chapal Lane Nugegoda

where the 9th Respondent is presently illegally and/or wrongfully carrying

on a business of an international School in contravention of the

Development Plan-Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council Area

(Zoning Regulations) 2008-2020 marked as P1.

2. The Royal Institute International School is now housed in two buildings

on premises bearing assessment Nos.10,17 and 19/1 Chapal Lane. Apart

from the said school, the 9th respondent is illegally constructing a fourteen

storied building on approximately 25 perches of land bearing assessment

No.12 Chapal Lane abutting a twenty feet road. The 10th Respondent who

is the Managing Director of Royal Institute (9th Respondent) in paragraph

5(jj) of his objection admits that he has got approval to construct a

building which consists of Basement, Ground and Mezzanine Floor plus

ten upper floors. Thus it is clear that the 9th Respondent is getting ready to

construct or constructing the said building.

3. According to the Development Plan-Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte

Municipal Council Area (Zoning Regulations) 2008-2020 marked

P1(page 3 of P1) the said Chapal Lane is situated in a Mixed

SC /FR/621/2010

5

Development Zone and educational institutes are not permitted to be

established.

4. The 9th Respondent has established an International School in Chapal

Lane which has resulted in severe inconvenience being caused to the

Petitioners and other residents of Chapal Lane. The school has a student

population of 2000 students. The 10th Respondent in paragraph 12 of his

affidavit admits that there is a school at Chapal Lane and the student

population of this school is 1900. The 10th Respondent in paragraph 5(c)

and (d) of his affidavit also admits that in the four schools of the 9th

Respondent (Havelock Road, Maya Avenue, Chapal Lane Nugegoda and

Maharagama) students are being trained for Cambridge GCE advanced

Level Examination. The 4th Respondent in paragraph 10 of his affidavit

too admits that the 9th Respondent is running an International School at

Chapal Lane Nugegoda. Thus it is established that 9th Respondent is

running a private International School at Chapal Lane Nugegoda and the

student population of the said school is 1900.

5. As a result of the aforementioned actions of the 9th Respondent, the

residents are being greatly inconvenienced especially due to traffic

congestion which has hampered daily activities of the residents. The noise

caused by the said school of the 9th Respondent and the traffic congestion

have made residing and travelling along the said Chapal Lane a near

impossibility and have violated the petitioner’s and the other resident’s

rights including the right of movement [paragraph 8(vi) and 8(vii) of the

petition].

SC /FR/621/2010

6. The 9th Respondent is in the process of constructing a high rise building

on a twenty five (25) perch block abutting 20 feet road at Chapal Lane,

Nugegoda. As per Planning & Building Regulations of UDA 2005

marked as P4, it is prohibited to construct high rise building in excess of

five (5) stories including the ground floor unless the plot of the land is

forty (40) perches. Further according to the said regulations, it is

prohibited to construct an aforementioned high rise building unless the

site abuts a street which is no less than twelve meters in width. The above

facts have been stated in paragraph 10(i), (iv) and (v) of the petition. [The

10th Respondent however in his affidavit admits that the building at No.10

and 12 Chapal Lane Nugegoda will consist of Basement, Ground Floor,

Mezzanine Floor plus ten upper floors.]

The Petitioners state that the site upon which the said high rise building is being

constructed abuts a street (Chapal Lane) of twenty (20) feet wide (approximately

6.1 meters) which is less than what is permitted by P4 [paragraph 10(vi) of the

petition]. The 4th respondent too, in his affidavit, admits that the width of the

said road is six meters.

The Petitioners further complain that running of a private school or

International School at Chapal Lane is illegal and constructing the

aforementioned high rise building is also illegal. The Petitioners inter alia moves

this court to grant the following reliefs.

1. A declaration declaring that the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed

by Article 12(1) and 14(1)(h) of the Constitution have been violated by

the 1st to 8th and 11th Respondents .

SC /FR/621/2010

7

2. A direction to the 1st to 8th and 11th Respondents to demolish all illegal

constructions pertaining to the buildings on premises bearing assessment

Nos.10 and 12 Chapal Lane Nugegoda.

3. An order directing the 2nd and/or 3rd Respondents to cancel all the permits

(if any) granted to Royal Institute to carry on business of International

School Chapal Lane, Nugegoda.

4. An order directing the 2nd Respondents and/or 3rd Respondents to take

steps to evict Royal Institute from premises situated at Chapal Lane,

Nugegoda.

I will now consider whether Chapal Lane Nugegoda falls within a Mixed

Development Zone or not. The 4th Respondent (Director General, Urban

Development Authority) in his affidavit filed in this court admits that Chapal

Lane Nugegoda falls within a Mixed Development Zone in Sri Jayawardenapura

Kotte Municipal Area. The document marked 9R17 was produced by the 10th

Respondent with his affidavit. This document (9R17) is a letter dated 22.6.2017

issued by the UDA to the 10th Respondent. The Director (Enforcement) UDA in

the said letter admits that the Chapal Lane Nugegoda falls within the Mixed

Development Zone in Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte Municipal Area. Considering

all the above matters, I hold that the Chapal Lane Nugegoda falls within a

Mixed Development Zone in Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte Municipal Area.

Learned President’s Counsel for the 9th and 10th Respondents contended that the

applicable Regulations are 9R4, 9R5,9R11 and 9R12. But when the above

documents are examined, it is clear that the said Regulations are applicable to

the Colombo Municipal Area. I have earlier held that Chapal Lane Nugegoda

SC /FR/621/2010

8

falls within the Mixed Development Zone in Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte

Municipal Area. For the above reasons I hold that above regulations

(9R4,9R5,9R11 and 9R12) are not applicable to Chapal Lane Nugegoda. The

10th Respondent who is the Managing Director of the Royal Institute (9th

Respondent) states, in his affidavit filed in this court, that the 9th Respondent

became the owner of the property at No.10, Chapal Lane, Nugegoda in April

1999. On an application dated 5.4.1999, Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal

Council issued a development permit marked 9R9 dated 4.6.99 to construct a

building (Teaching Block) consisting of ground floor plus four (4) upper floors.

What is the applicable regulation, in the year 1999, to issue the Development

Permit marked 9R9? The Regulations published in Government Gazette

No.392/9 dated 10.3.1986 marked P4 were in operation in the year 1999. These

Regulations were in operation in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council

area until Regulations marked P1 and P3 came into operation on 21.4.2008.

Therefore when Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council issued the said

development permit marked 9R9 to the 10th Respondent, the applicable

regulations were the regulations marked P4. The 10th Respondent constructed a

building at No.10, Chapal Lane, Nugegoda and he is now running a school in

this building. Therefore the building permitted by the development permit

marked 9R9 has now been completed. The 10th Respondent later made another

application to build a building consisting of ground floor plus ten upper floors

at No.12 Chapal Lane Nugegoda. Learned President’s Counsel appearing for 9th

and 10thRespondents contended that Section 6(3)(c) of the Interpretation

Ordinance should apply to all applications made by the 9th and 10th Respondents

SC /FR/621/2010

9

to construct buildings. Section 6(3)(c) of the Interpretation Ordinance reads as

follows.

“Whenever any written law repeals either in whole or part a former written law,

such repeal shall not, in the absence of any express provision to that effect,

affect or be deemed to have affected-

(a) omitted

(b) omitted

(c) any action, proceeding, or thing pending or incomplete when the

repealing written law comes into operation, but every such action,

proceeding, or thing may be carried on and completed as if there had

been no such repeal.”

The building consisting of ground floor plus four (4) upper floors has now been

completed. Construction of an additional building at No.10 Chapal Lane,

Nugegoda has been admitted by the 9th and 10th Respondents in their written

submissions dated 19.9.2018. The inspection report marked 4R11 establishes the

fact that two buildings (Ground floor + three floors and Ground floor + four

floors) already exist at No 10 and 12 Chapal Lane Nugegoda. Thus if this

building too is also completed there will be three buildings at No.10 and 12

Chapal Lane, Nugegoda. When I consider all the above matters, I am of the

opinion that Section 6(3)(c) of the Interpretation Ordinance does not apply to

this building. I have earlier pointed out that when 9th Respondent purchased the

premises at No.10, Chapal Lane Nugegoda and when the development permit

marked 9R9 was issued to the 10th Respondent, the applicable regulations were

SC /FR/621/2010

10

the regulations marked P4. The 9th Respondent made an application to construct

a building consisting of ground floor plus four (4) upper floors at No.10, Chapal

Lane Nugegoda and the development permit marked 9R9 was also issued.

According to Section 27(1) of the Regulations marked P4, to construct a

building consisting of ground floor plus four (4) upper floors, the minimum plot

size (the extent of the land) should be 40 perches. But the extent of the land at

No.10, Chapal Lane is only 38.6 perches. The 10th Respondent in his affidavit

[paragraph 5(m)] too admits that the extent of this land is only38.6 perches.

Therefore according Section 27(1) of the Regulations marked P4, this building

consisting of ground floor plus four (4) upper floors cannot be permitted to be

built. Further when 10th Respondent started constructing this building ground

floor plus four (4) upper floors, there was already a building consisting of

ground floor plus three (3) upper floors at No.10, Chapal Lane Nugegoda and a

certificate of conformity [COC] marked 9R8 had already been issued to this

building. This position has been admitted by the 10th Respondent in his affidavit

[paragraphs 5(n) and 5(o) of the affidavit of 10th Respondent]. Thus building had

taken a certain extent of the land of 38.6 perches. Then how did the UDA issue a

permit to construct another building at No.10, Chapal Lane Nugegoda? How can

there be two buildings [one is ground floor plus three (3) upper floors and the

other one is ground floor plus four (4) upper floors] on a land extent of which is

only 38.6 perches? On this ground alone the 2nd building [ground floor plus four

(4) upper floors] at No.10, Chapal Lane Nugegoda for which development

permit marked 9R9 had been issued can be declared an illegal building. Learned

President’s Counsel appearing for 9th and 10th Respondents tried to advance an

argument that both these buildings could be permitted since the two blocks of

SC /FR/621/2010

11

land at No.10 and 12 Chapal Lane have been amalgamated. I now advert to this

contention. After the amalgamation what is the extent of the entire land? It is

(38.6+26) 64.6 perches. To permit two buildings on this amalgamated land,

there must be eighty (80) perches according to Section 27 of the Regulations

marked P4. When I consider the above matters, I feel that both buildings cannot

be permitted. For the above reasons, I reject the above contention of learned

President’s Counsel for the 9th and 10th Respondents.

Learned President’s Counsel for the 9th and 10th Respondents tried to contend

that the 2nd building [building consisting ground floor plus four (4) upper floors]

at No.10, Chapal Lane Nugegoda had been regularized. He relied on a document

marked 4R11 which is said to be an inspection report. This is a document which

has been issued by UDA. When I examine the date on which it has been signed,

the said date has been interpolated. It appears that 1/3/08 had been interpolated

to read as 1/3/11. At this stage it is interesting to point out a letter signed by the

Chairman of UDA marked 9R26 directing the 10th Respondent to demolish both

buildings [ground floor+ 3 upper floors and ground floor + 4 upper floors] at

No.10, Chapal Lane. The date of this latter is 8th Nov 2010. The date of the

inspection report marked 9R11 had been interpolated to read as 1/3/2011 when

the original date appears to be 1/3/2008. I would like to point out again that the

Chairman of the UDA by the said letter marked 9R26 directed the 10th

Respondent to demolish both buildings at No.10 and 12 Chapal Lane,

Nugegoda. It has to be noted here that Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal

Council issued Development Permit marked 9R9 to construct a building

consisting of ground floor + 4 upper floors at No.10 Chapal Lane, Nugegoda.

But when the building was completed surprisingly the building was having

SC /FR/621/2010

12

ground floor + 5 upper floors. Learned President’s Counsel who appeared for

the 9th and 10th Respondents admitted before us that the 2nd building, as at

present, was having ground floor + 5 upper floors. Therefore it has to be noted

here that one additional upper floor in this building has come up violating the

building permit marked 9R9. Thus 9th and 10th Respondents have intentionally

violated the building Permit marked 9R9. When I consider all the above matters,

I hold that the 2nd building [before construction, ground floor + four upper floors

but after the construction, ground floor + 5 upper floors] is an illegal building

and cannot be permitted to stand.

I would like to point out another illegality with regard to the 2nd building [before

construction, ground floor + four upper floors but after the construction ground

floor + 5 upper floors] No.10 Chapal Lane, Nugegoda. Regulation No. 27(2) of

P4 reads as follows.

“No plan of the sight shall be approved for the construction of a highrise

building unless:-

(1) omitted

(2) the site abuts on a street which is not less than 12 meters in width.”

Thus according to the said Regulation No.27(2) in order to construct a building

consisting of ground floor + 4 upper floors the width of the access road cannot

be less than 12 meters. The access road is the Chapal Lane. What is the width of

the access road? It is only 6 meters wide. The Petitioners state width of the

Chapal Lane is only 6 meters. The 4th Respondent too in his affidavit admits this

position. Therefore the 2nd building [before construction, ground floor + four

SC /FR/621/2010

13

upper floors but after the construction, ground floor + 5 upper floors] at No.10

Chapal Lane, Nugegoda cannot be permitted to stand on the ground. When I

consider all the above matters, I hold that the 2nd building even if it has only

ground floor + four upper floors would be an illegal building and therefore

cannot be permitted to stand on the ground.

I would like to point out another matter. Learned counsel for the 2nd Respondent

(Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council) very honourably admitted

before us that no COC (Cetificate of Confirmation) had been issued by the said

Municipal Council for the 2nd building [before construction, ground floor + four

upper floors but after the construction ground floor + 5 upper floors] at No.10

Chapal Lane, Nugegoda. Then can anybody occupy this building? The present

regulations applicable to construction in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal

Council area are marked as P1 and P3 which came into operation on 21.4.2008

by Government Gazette No.1546/3. According to Section 28(1) of the said

Regulations, no person is permitted to occupy a building if COC is not issued to

the building. The 10th Respondent in his affidavit admits that he is running a

school at Chapal Lane, Nugegoda and that the student population is around

1900. The running of the said school in the 2nd building at No.10 Chapal Lane,

Nugegoda is illegal since COC had not been issued to the said building.

I will now consider whether the 9th and the 10th Respondents have got

permission to run a school at Chapal Lane, Nugegoda. The 10th Respondent has

produced a certificate marked 9R3A which states that Royal Institute at No.191,

Havelock Road, Colombo 05 is registered as an Institute to conduct Courses and

Examination in Computer Programming, Secretarial Practice and English

Language. But the 9th and the 10th Respondents have not produced any

SC /FR/621/2010

14

certificate or a document which gives permission to run a school at Chapal Lane

Nugegoda. The regulations relating to construction, business and etc. are found

in documents marked P1 and P3 which came into operation on 21.4.2008 by

Government Gazette No.1546/3. Since the 9th and the 10th Respondents have not

got any approval to run a Private School at Chapal Lane, Nugegoda, whether

they can run a Private School at Chapal Lane, Nugegoda has to be considered

under the new regulations marked P1 and P3. I have earlier pointed out that

Chapal Lane, Nugegoda comes under Mixed Development Zone in Sri

Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council Area. According to page 9 of P1,

schools and/or International Schools are not permitted in Mixed Development

Zone. Therefore no person is permitted to run schools and/or International

Schools at Chapal Lane, Nugegoda. For the above reasons, I hold that running of

Private Schools and/or International Schools at Chapal Lane, Nugegoda is

illegal and that the 9th and/or the 10th Respondents cannot run any Private

Schools and/or International Schools at Chapal Lane, Nugegoda. Since the 10th

Respondent has in his affidavit admitted that he runs a school in the name of

Royal Institute in both buildings at No.10 Chapal Lane, Nugegoda, he must stop

running of schools at Chapal Lane, Nugegoda.

The10th Respondent has made an application to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte

Municipal Council to construct a building consisting of Basement, Mezzanine

floor plus ten upper floors at No. 10 and12 Chapal Lane, Nugegoda. The extent

of this land is only 64.6 perches. The plan for this building has been submitted

to Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte Municipal Council on 27.2.2008 (vide

endorsement on 9R23, the proposed plan). Thus the applicable regulations are

the regulations found at document marked P4. The width of the Chapal Lane is

SC /FR/621/2010

15

only 6 meters. Thus according to Section 27(2) of the said regulations which I

have referred to earlier, this building cannot be permitted to be built and if the

said building has already been constructed it has to be demolished. When I

consider the aforementioned matters, I hold that the development permit issued

to construct the above mentioned building marked 9R22 extended by 9R24 has

violated the above regulations and that therefore it becomes an illegal document.

However learned President’s Counsel (PC) appearing for the 9th and the 10th

Respondents admitted at the hearing before us that there is no any building at

No.12, Chapal Lane Nugegoda and that the development permit issued to

construct the above mentioned building marked 9R22 extended by 9R24 has

now lapsed. However if the building shown in 9R23 has been constructed or part

of the said building has been constructed at No.12, Chapal Lane Nugegoda, the

1st and the 2nd Respondents should take all steps to demolish the said building. I

have earlier held that the 2nd building (before construction, ground floor + four

upper floors but after construction, the building was having ground floor + five

upper floors) at No.10, Chapal Lane, Nugegoda is an illegal building; that

running of any Private School and/or International School at Chapal lane is

illegal; and that the Development Permit marked 9R22 extended by 9R24 is

illegal. The 1st and the 2nd Respondents have permitted the aforementioned

actions. For the above reasons, I hold that the1st and the 2nd Respondents have

violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioners guaranteed by Article 12(1)

and 14(1)(h) of the Constitution.

For the aforementioned reasons, I make the following orders.

SC /FR/621/2010

16

1. The 1st and the 2nd Respondents are directed to demolish all illegal

constructions pertaining to the buildings on premises bearing assessment

Nos.10 and 12, Chapal Lane, Nugegoda.

2. The 2nd Respondent is also directed to cancel all permits (if any) granted

to royal Institute, the 9th Respondent to carry on business of an

International School at Chapal Lane Nugegoda.

The 1st and 2nd Respondents are given three months time from the date of this

judgment to comply with the directions given in this judgment.
