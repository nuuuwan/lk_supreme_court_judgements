The town sits on the main Jaffna-Kankesanthurai road and the Jaffna-Kankesanthurai railway line. The area is densely populated. It is a hive of commercial and agricultural activity. There are several renowned Hindu temples including the Maruthanamadam Anjaneyar temple, some Christian churches and several schools and offices in the area. The famed Kandarodai [Kadurugoda] archaeological site and Kadurugoda Viharaya are close to Chunnakam. In this application, the petitioner complains that the 8th respondent company has operated a thermal power station in Chunnakam in a manner which has polluted groundwater in the Chunnakam area and made groundwater unfit for human use. The petitioner accuses the Central Environmental Authority [\u201cCEA\u201d] , the Ceylon Electricity Board [\u201cCEB\u201d], the Provincial and Local Authorities, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka [\u201cBOI\u201d] and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board [\u201cNWSDB\u201d], who are named as the 1st to 7th respondents and 10th and 11th added respondents, of having failed to enforce the law against the 8th respondent and of having failed to stop the 8th respondent polluting groundwater and having failed in their duty to act in the best interests of the public. The petitioner states that, thereby, the respondents have violated the fundamental rights guaranteed to the petitioner and to the residents of the Chunnakam area by Articles 12 (1) of the Constitution",

They say that electricity services in the Jaffna peninsula had been disrupted during the war and that, while the war was underway, the 8th respondent commenced constructing its thermal power station in 2007, in order to provide electricity to the residents of the Jaffna peninsula. The respondents say that this thermal power station commenced its operations in 2009 and that, as soon as conditions permitted after the end of the war in 2009, the respondents have taken adequate measures to ensure that the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station does not cause pollution. The respondents state that they have complied with the provisions of the law and that, from 2010, the 8th respondent has operated its thermal power station under the authority of duly issued Environmental Protection Licenses, and without causing pollution of groundwater or other components of the environment. The respondents state that they have duly performed their duties and responsibilities. They also state that the 8th respondent cannot be held solely responsible for any pollution of groundwater which may have occurred in the past. In addition to submitting detailed pleadings, the parties have produced a mass of documents in support of their respective positions. It will be useful to firstly describe the historical background which led to the establishment of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station in Chunnakam. Historical background Since 1958, a significant portion of the electric power requirements of residents of the Chunnakam area and the other areas of the Jaffna Peninsula were serviced by the State owned \u201cChunnakam Power Station\u201d [sometimes referred to as the \u201cCentral Power Station\u201d] situated in Chunnakam and operated by the CEB. It was a diesel fired 14 MW thermal power station which stood on a large area of land possessed by the CEB. That land is within the general area of the Chunnakam town. During the war, the functioning of the CEB\u201fs Chunnakam Power Station was hampered and its output was reduced. This led to two independent power producers being requested to install and operate power stations in the Jaffna peninsula during the war. One of these was a thermal power station which used heavy fuel oil/diesel to fire its generator sets and was owned by a Company named \u201cAggreko\u201d. It commenced operating during the war and continued for close to a decade until it was closed down in or about 2012. It was located in Chunnakam within the land possessed by the CEB and very close to the CEB\u201fs Chunnakam Power Station. The other thermal power station is said to have been operated by another independent power producer in the Kankesanturai area.",

In this background the 8th respondent company [ie: \u201cNorthern Power Company (Pvt) Ltd\u201d] was incorporated in 2007 to carry on the business of power generation and supply. The 8th respondent then entered into an agreement with the BOI in terms of which the 8th respondent agreed and undertook to set up and operate a thermal power station in the Jaffna peninsula. In pursuance of this agreement, the 8th respondent took on lease from the CEB an allotment of land within the CEB\u201fs aforesaid land in Chunnakam. The 8th respondent constructed its thermal power station on that leased land. It was in very close proximity to the CEB\u201fs existing Chunnakam Power Station. The 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station used heavy fuel oil/diesel to operate its generator sets [the 8th respondent company is referred to as the \u201cNorthern Power Company (Pvt) Ltd\u201d or \u201cNorthern Power\u201d or \u201cNPCL\u201d or \u201cNPC\u201d in the documents produced in this application and cited later on in this judgment. Any such references will mean the 8th respondent]. After the end of the war, the CEB decommissioned its ageing and inefficient Chunnakam Power Station in or about the end of 2012 and replaced it with a new thermal power station which uses heavy fuel oil/diesel to operate the generator sets and has a power generation capacity of approximately 24 MW. This also stood within the land possessed by the CEB and very close to the other three thermal power stations. This new thermal power station was christened the \u201cUthuru Janani\u201d Power Station. It commenced generating electrical power in early 2013. It should also be mentioned that to two oil tanks within the CEB\u201fs premises were extensively damaged in 1990-1991 and a very large quantity of fuel oil/diesel flowed on to the adjacent land. This formed what the residents of the area dubbed the \u201coil kulam\u201d [oil pond]. In 2012, the CEB filled up this \u201coil kulam\u201d with earth and constructed a Grid Station on that area of land. The petition and interlocutory orders made by Court",

It is now necessary to ascertain the stage at which a project proponent who wishes to embark on a \u201cprescribed project\u201d must obtain approval from the \u201cproject approving agency\u201d for the implementation of the project. In this connection, section 23AA in Part IVC of the Act states that a project proponent \u201c\u2026will be required to obtain approval under this Act for the implementation of such prescribed projects.\u201d In the context in which the word \u201cimplementation\u201d is used in section 23AA, the word has to be taken in the sense of \u201cto put (a decision or plan) into effect\u201d set out in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary [5th ed. Vol. 1 at p. 1330]. Thus, the term \u201cimplementation\u201d used in section 23AA would include any work on the physical implementation of the project from the stage of groundwork on the site and its environs onwards. This view is supported by clause 5 and 6 of the National Environmental (Procedure for approval of projects) Regulations No. 1 of 1993 which require that a project proponent who wishes to embark on a \u201cprescribed project\u201d must apply for approval under Part IVC \u201cas early as possible\u201d.

Provision is made for the public to have their say where a \u201cprescribed project\u201d may have a significant impact on the environment and an EIAR has been submitted.

The requirement that an EPL must be obtained before the commencement of a \u201cprescribed activity\u201d is put beyond any doubt by clause 14 of the aforesaid regulations which states \u201cAny person who operates a prescribed activity shall obtain a license from the Authority prior to the commencement of such activity.\u201d The requirement that an EPL must be obtained before the commencement of a \u201cprescribed activity\u201d is also reflected in clause 5 (1) of these regulations which specifies that an application for an EPL must be submitted at least thirty days prior to the commencement of a \u201cprescribed activity\u201d. Thus, the statutory and regulatory requirement was that the 8th respondent had to obtain an EPL from the CEA [or the BOI] before the 8th respondent commenced \u201ccarrying on\u201d the activity of its thermal power station - ie: before the 8th respondent commenced operating its thermal power station and generating electrical power. In this regard, the letter dated 20th May 2010 written by the CEA to the 8th Respondent and marked \u201c2R16\u201d reveals that the 8th Respondent applied to the CEA on 12th October 2009 for the issue of an EPL. The Inspection Report marked \u201c2R2\u201d shows that there were 35 employees at the thermal power station on 27th October 2009. The observations made in \u201c2R2\u201d by the inspecting officers note that \u201cWaste water/Effluent is black in colour: waste water is not treated: discharged in to an open land\u201d; \u201cAir emission: 5th chimney is not functioning properly\u201d; \u201cNoise and vibration - High\u201d. Thereafter, although the format of the inspection report marked \u201c2R2\u201d provided for the inspecting officers to state whether they recommended that an EPL be issued or refused and to make their comments with regard to that recommendation, the inspecting officers have not made any recommendation or comments in that regard on \u201c2R2\u201d. The fact that the 8th respondent had 35 employees on site at Chunnakam on 27th October 2009 and the other contents of the inspection report including the aforesaid observations suggests that the thermal power station was in operating condition by 27th October 2009. Accordingly, it can be reasonably assumed that the 8th respondent was ready to commence commercially operating its thermal power station on or soon after 27th October 2009.",

Therefore, the observation in \u201c8R7\u201d that no Oil and Grease content was detected in w-ell water has to be discounted to the extent that the applicable standard for potable water specified by the Sri Lanka Standards Institute has not been applied in \u201c8R7\u201d.

Although the results show good insight into the potential presence of petroleum hydrocarbons, the authors stress that twelve samples cannot represent the vast and diverse Chunnakam aquifer. Undoubtedly, oil traces and distinct smells were reported from a number of drinking and irrigation wells in and around Chunnakam. It is quite likely that the hydrocarbon plume moved from CPSC [the Chunnakam Power Station Complex referred to earlier] after the monsoon rains, but hydrocarbon levels reduced over time due to physical, chemical and microbial degradation in soil and water matrices.\u201d. \u201c8R7\u201d also states that \u201cAll observations and reports confirmed the presence of oil traces in the wells in recent years without substantive evidence of the nature of the oil.\u201d The last report prepared in 2015 is a report dated September 2015 prepared by an `Experts Committee\u201f appointed by the Northern Provincial Council.",

It appears to me that, when these four factors are taken into account, the probability is that the Oil and Grease content detected in the samples of well water tested by the NWSDB had a significant percentage of petroleum-based hydrocarbon contaminants such as fuel oil and lubricating oil discharged from the several thermal power stations and seeping from the oil kulam within the Chunnakam Power Station Complex. For the reasons set out above, I am not inclined to disregard the results recorded by the NWSDB in \u201cP21\u201d and other reports. In this connection, it is relevant to note that the results recorded by the NWSDB in \u201cP21\u201d and other reports during the period 2012 to 2014 are not dissimilar to the results recorded in tests done by the CEA in 2014 and by the ITI in 2015.

    "text": "To conclude, the picture that emerges from these reports and documents is clear and establishes that groundwater in the area around the Chunnakam Power Station Complex has been contaminated with oil from 2008 onwards. Test reports establish that the level of contamination was significant in 2012, 2013 and up to 2014 and then has shown a trend of declining from 2015 onwards. However, oil contamination of groundwater was still significant in the vicinity of the Chunnakam Power Station Complex in 2016 and 2017. To now turn to the second question of whether the operations of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station have caused or contributed towards that pollution. To start with the years 2009 and 2010 - ie: prior to the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station commencing commercial operations on 10th December 2009 and the following year - the inspection report marked \u201c2R2\u201d records that, on 27th October 2009, untreated black coloured wastewater and effluent was being discharged onto an \u201copen land\u201d. The CEA\u201fs report marked \u201c2R9\u201d states that, at this time, the 8th respondent had not put in place \u201cadequate mitigatory measures for Pollution control\u201d and that oil contaminated water was being discharged onto an adjoining land. Similarly, the CEA\u201fs later report marked \u201c2R14\u201d states that \u201cNorthern Power Plant was established in 2009 during war period without adequate measures for pollution control such as oil separators or any type of treatment for oil contaminated waste water prior to discharge. They discharged contaminated water into another adjoining land belongs to CEB. It is observed as another `oil kulam\u201f situated very close vicinity (about 200m distance). Occasional diesel spillages and the disposal of oil contaminated rags and spent oil filters etc. accumulated at the back yard of Northern Power Plant which was disposed in the open space may also have contributed in some extent for the pollution caused. The inspections carried out on 2009-1-27 by the CEA confirmed this situation and upon instructions given, the rectification and mitigation measures were adopted.. As a result an oil-water separation",

However, the report marked \u201c8R5\u201d observes that, even in July 2015, there were a still few shortcomings in the waste management system, procedures and practices in the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station and that there was still a possibility of oil contaminated storm water flowing from the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station onto adjoining lands. The Order of the learned Magistrate also reports oil leaks and spillages in the 8th respondent\u201fs premises. To conclude, the picture that emerges from the reports and other documents is clear and establishes that, from 2008 onwards and up to about 2012, the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station had been discharging oil contaminated wastewater onto an adjoining land and has, thereby, caused oil contamination of groundwater in a large area of land around the Chunnakam Power Station Complex and also caused oil contamination of soil in the vicinity of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station. Further, during this period, the waste management system, procedures and practices in the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station have been inadequate and there was a likelihood that leakages of oil from machinery and inadvertent spillages of oil within the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station would have been washed out on to adjoining lands via the drainage system and also permeated into the soil within the 8th respondent\u201fs premises and, thereby, caused further oil contamination of groundwater and soil in the area. The reports and documents before us lead, plainly and inevitably, to these conclusions and require no `technical expertise\u201f or knowledge on the part of the Court to arrive at these conclusions. This is not a case where petitioner calls upon the Court to rule on the soundness of an EIAR as was the case in PUBLIC INTEREST LAW FOUNDATION vs. CENTRAL ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHORITY [2001 3 SLR 330] or the environmental impact of a proposed project as was the case in AUSTRALIA CONSERVATION FOUNDATION INCORPORATED vs. MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY [2017 FCAFC 134], cited by learned Senior State Counsel. Reaching the conclusions set out above certainly does not require us to \u201csit in judgment over the cutting edge of scientific analysis\u201d to use the words of Rajendra Babu J in the Supreme Court of India in ND JAYAL vs. UNION OF INDA [AIR 2004 SC 867 at para 19]. The material before us in the reports marked \u201cP21\u201d, \u201c2R9\u201d,\u201d \u201c2R14\u201d,\u201c8R5\u201d,\u201c8R6\u201d and \u201c10R7\u201d indicates that, the operations of the CEB\u201fs Chunnakam Power Station has been a significant cause of oil contamination of groundwater and soil in the Chunnakam area",

The operations of Aggreko\u201fs thermal power station also appear to have caused some extent of oil contamination of the surrounding environs. The very large quantity of fuel oil/diesel which flowed out of the two oil tanks damaged in 1990-1991 and the oil kulam which formed on the land near the CEB\u201fs Chunnakam Power Station were also significant causes of oil contamination of groundwater and soil in the Chunnakam area. Consequently, the 8th respondent is certainly not the sole cause of oil contamination of groundwater and soil in the Chunnakam area. There were several actors and causes for that pollution. But, quite obviously, where there is clear evidence to establish that the 8th respondent caused oil contamination of groundwater and soil, the fact that there were other polluters who did the same, did not give the 8th respondent the license to pollute and does not absolve 8th respondent from being held accountable for the pollution it caused. Similarly, fact that there were other polluters did not entitle the CEA and the CEB to fail to perform their statutory duties and responsibilities with regard to enforcing the law in respect of the operations of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station.

Moreover, they would, in my view, be binding if they have been either expressly enacted or become a part of the domestic law by adoption by the superior Courts of record and by the Supreme Court in particular, in their decisions.\u201d. In WIJEBANDA vs. CONSERVATOR GENERAL OF FORESTS [2009 1 SLR 337 at p.358-359], Tilakawardane J observed \u201cAlthough the international instruments and constitutional provisions cited above are not legally binding upon governments, they constitute an important part of our environmental protection regime. As evidenced by the decision of this court in Bulankulama v. Secretary, Ministry of Industrial Development, they constitute a form of soft law, the importance and relevance of which must be recognized when reviewing executive action vis-a-vis the environment.\u201d. In the light of these observations made by two eminent judges of this Court, I have no hesitation in being guided by the Principles of the Rio Declaration when considering the importance of ensuring that an IEER or EIAR is obtained and considered prior to granting approval for the implementation of a \u201cprescribed project\u201d and in determining the significance of a failure to do so by the BOI and/or CEA. In my view, these observations highlight the vital importance of the CEA and the BOI ensuring the submission and consideration of an IEER or EIAR and giving the public an opportunity to make their comments and, where required, be heard, prior to the grant of approval for the implementation of a \u201cprescribed project\u201d. This procedure is an essential safeguard put in place by the Act to ensure that the possible adverse environmental effects of \u201cprescribed projects\u201d are ascertained and minimised. Therefore, this procedure had to be followed by the BOI and the CEA and could not be dispensed with. The BOI and the CEA were required to perform these duties and obligations vested in them by the provisions of Part IV C of the Act and the National Environmental (Procedure for approval of projects) Regulations No. 1 of 1993 keeping in mind that doing so was not only their statutory and regulatory duty but also that these powers have been conferred on them in the public trust. This Court has, in several decisions such as WIJEBANDA vs. CONSERVATOR GENERAL OF FORESTS, SUGATHAPALA MENDIS vs. CHANDRIKA KUMARATUNGE [2008 2 SLR 339], ENVIRONMENTAL FOUNDATION LTD vs. MAHAWELI AUTHORITY OF SRI LANKA and PREMALAL PERERA vs. TISSA KARALIYADDE [SC FR 891/2009 decided on 31st March 2016], recognised and given effect to the public trust doctrine. In the renowned \u201cMono Lake Case\u201d [33 Cal. 419 at p.21], the Supreme Court of California stated \"Thus the public trust is more than an affirmation of state power to use public property for public purposes.

This oft cited observation highlights the duty placed on the State and its agencies to protect the environment and the fact that this duty is vested in the State and its agencies as the trustees of the public. Thus, Broussard J observed [at p.2] \u201c\u2026.. public trust protects environmental and recreational values\u2026.\u201d Consequently, the BOI and the CEA\u201fs duty to ensure that the provisions of Part IV C of the Act and the National Environmental (Procedure for approval of projects) Regulations No. 1 of 1993 [including obtaining and considering an IEER or EIAR] were strictly complied with prior to the 8th respondent implementing its project to add power generation capacity, were statutory and regulatory duties and powers conferred on the BOI and the CEA in the public trust. A failure to duly perform those duties and duly exercise those powers amounts to a breach of the public trust reposed in the CEA and the BOI. Next, in WIJEBANDA vs. CONSERVATOR GENERAL OF FORESTS [at p. 356] Tilakawardane J. stated \u201cThe constitution in Article 27 (14) of the directive principles of state policy enjoins the state to protect, preserve and improve the environment.

Therefore, an arbitrary or unreasonable failure on the part of the CEA and the BOI to perform their duties under the National Environmental Act and the regulations made thereunder which causes loss, damage and inconvenience to the residents of the Chunnakam area, will entail a violation of their rights guaranteed by Article 12 (1).

As stated earlier, learned Senior State Counsel has submitted that, due to conditions prevailing in the Jaffna peninsula at the time the project to add power generation capacity was implemented, it was not feasible to go through the procedure spelt out in Part IV C of the Act. There is no merit in this submission since, as stated earlier, the addition of power generation capacity took place in or about 2012, which was long after conditions of normalcy and a fully functional civilian administration and bureaucracy were in place in the Jaffna peninsula. It is evident from the documents before us that the CEA had a Provincial Office in Jaffna at the time. Furthermore, it is public knowledge that the BOI had an office in Jaffna from 2010 onwards. Therefore, I see no reason why the BOI and CEA could not have ensured that the procedure spelled out in Part IVC of the Act and the aforesaid Regulations No. 1 of 1993 was followed by the 8th respondent prior to increasing the power generating capacity of the thermal power station. Learned Senior State Counsel went on to submit that the stage of conducting an IEER or EIAR has long passed and that it was not feasible to conduct an IEER or an EIAR at this stage. It is now about seven years since the addition of power generation capacity. The environmental impact of the operation of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station with the additional power generating capacity has been established with the passage of time and is seen in the material referred to earlier. In these circumstances, I see no purpose in going through the IEER/EIAR process at this stage. To now consider whether the fundamental rights guaranteed to residents of the Chunnakam area and the petitioner by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution were violated by the CEA and BOI permitting the 8th respondent to operate its thermal power station without the authority of an EPL [vide: the second issue considered earlier], it is evident from the statutory and regulatory framework in part IV A of the Act and the National Environmental (Protection and Quality) Regulations No. 01 of 2008, that the CEA and",

I have earlier held that the operation of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station caused oil contamination of groundwater in the Chunnakam area and of soil in the vicinity of the thermal power station. The terms and condition of the four EPLs issued to the 8th respondent stipulate, inter alia, that \u201cFuel shall be stored in properly sealed tanks. Adequate precautionary measures shall be taken to avoid any accidental spillages of fuel oil in the storage/dispensing/ handling point\u201d; \u201cCleanliness and good house keeping practices especially in and around the wastewater treatment plant shall be adopted\u201d; \u201cAll wastewaters arising from the operations shall conform to the `Tolerance Limits for Discharge of Industrial wastewater into Inland Surface Waters\u201f prior to discharge\u201d; \u201cNo oil or grease shall be discharged into surface water or to the ground\u201d; and \u201cNo wastewater shall be discharged into storm water drains\u201d.

The CEA and BOI have claimed that inspections of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station did not reveal any irregularities in the management and disposal of wastewater and other effluents. But these claims are contradicted and disproved by the reports and other material before this Court. Therefore, these claims made by the CEA and BOI must be rejected. Another area that causes concern is the fact that the CEA and the BOI were placed on notice by the complaints received from the public in 2011 and the findings of the ITI in the report marked \u201c10R7\u201d in 2012 that oil contaminated wastewater from the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station was ending up on an open land and that the measures adopted by the 8th respondent to contain oil leakages were patently inadequate.

Thus, the CEA\u201fs own report marked \u201c2R14\u201d recognises that the 8th respondent had been discharging oil contaminated wastewater onto an adjoining land over a considerable period of time. Section 23D of the Act empowered the CEA or BOI to suspend or cancel the EPL if the 8th respondent carried out the \u201cprescribed activity\u201d [ie: operated its thermal power station] in violation of the terms, standards and conditions specified in that EPL and/or in the Act and regulations made under the Act. Similarly, clause 9 of the National Environmental (Protection and Quality) Regulations No. 01 of 2008 required the CEA and the BOI to suspend or cancel an EPL where continued discharge, deposit or emission of waste into the environment as a result of the \u201cprescribed activity\u201d has adversely affected the beneficial use of the environment. However, it is evident that neither the CEA nor the BOI has attempted to use these powers vested in them to ensure that the 8th respondent complied with the terms and conditions stipulated in the EPLs issued to the 8th respondent. I must also advert to the fact that the letter dated 30th September 2014 marked \u201c10R13\u201d reveals that the first time the CEA and BOI realized that the nature of the 8th respondent\u201fs operations required a SWML, was in September 2014. This was a very belated realisation since a rudimentary knowledge of the nature of operations of a thermal power station and common sense would make one aware that a thermal power station will produce oil contaminated wastewater, waste oil and sludge. Thus, the report marked \u201c8R5\u201d prepared by the ITI and submitted to the CEB states that oil-fired thermal power stations \u201ccan become a possible source of soil and water contamination with oil, if the raw materials (fuel and lube oil stocks) and liquid/solid wastes (oily water and oil sludge) are not managed properly.\u201d. Further, the report marked \u201c10R7\u201d prepared by the ITI and submitted to the BOI in October 2012 [ie: almost two years before the 8th respondent was required to obtain a SWML] made a specific recommendation that the 8th respondent should treat wastewater \u201cto comply with relevant effluent discharge standards.\u201d. Thus, the CEA and the BOI should have realised, long before 30th September 2014, that the 8th respondent must be required to obtain a SWML. The fact that this realisation was reached only on 30th September 2014 - almost five years after the thermal power station commenced commercial operations - suggests incompetency or disinterest or a deliberate overlooking of an essential requirement.",

Before concluding this section, it should be mentioned that the ITI\u201fs report dated 10th September 2019 marked \u201c8R9\u201d indicated that the water in the well within the 8th respondent\u201fs premises was not contaminated with oil. However, that cannot negate the substantial evidence which was discussed earlier, which establishes that the discharge of oil contaminated wastewater from the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station has contaminated groundwater in the Chunnakam area and soil in the vicinity of the thermal power station. In this regard, it has to be recognised that the quality of water in the well within the 8th respondent\u201fs premises could be an anomaly caused by factors such as the depth of the well, the impermeable nature of its construction and the passage of time. I have previously held that the failure on the part of the CEA and BOI to perform their duty under the provisions of the Act and the National Environmental (Protection and Quality) Regulations No. 01 of 2008, to prevent the 8th respondent from operating its thermal power station without the authority of an EPL [for several periods of time] and to enforce the terms and conditions of the EPLs which were issued to the 8th respondent from time to time, has exacerbated the pollution of groundwater in the Chunnakam area and soil in the vicinity of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station and caused prejudice to the residents of the Chunnakam area and the petitioner [who is a member of the public]. If the CEA and BOI had acted diligently to fulfil their duties and prevented the 8th respondent from operating without the authority of an EPL for several periods of time and also ensured that the 8th respondent adhered to the terms and conditions specified in the EPLs that were issued from time to time, the pollution caused by the 8th respondent could have been avoided, or at the least minimised to the extent permitted by law. For these reasons and applying the principles set out earlier, I hold that the aforesaid failures, omissions and inaction on the part of the CEA and the BOI were arbitrary and unreasonable and in a breach of the public trust reposed in the CEA and the BOI and, thereby, constituted a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the residents of the Chunnakam area and the petitioner by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

As a result, the pollution of groundwater in the Chunnakam area and soil in the vicinity of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station has been exacerbated and the residents of the Chunnakam area and the petitioner [who is a member of the public] have been prejudiced. For these reasons and applying the principles set out earlier, I hold that the failure on the part of the CEA and BOI to perform their statutory and regulatory duties under the provisions of Act and the National Environmental (Protection and Quality) Regulations No. 01 of 2008 and prevent the 8th respondent from operating its thermal power station in a manner which caused oil contamination of groundwater in the Chunnakam area and of soil in the vicinity of the thermal power station, was arbitrary and unreasonable and in breach of the public trust reposed in the CEA and the BOI and, thereby, constituted a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the residents of the Chunnakam area and the petitioner by Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Before concluding this section, I should refer to the 8th respondent\u201fs submission that the petitioner has misrepresented the effect of the letters marked \u201cP6\u201d and \u201cP7\u201d and held out that these letters related to the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station. The 8th respondent submits that the petitioner had also suppressed the fact that EPLs had been issued prior to \u201cP23\u201d. It has to be recognised that, as is often the case in public interest litigation, the petitioner was hampered by a lack of access to documentation in the hands of the respondents and I am unable to conclude that these alleged misrepresentations were deliberate. More importantly, the alleged misrepresentations are not material in the light of the issue before the Court. I am not inclined to dismiss this application solely on the basis of these alleged misrepresentations. The 8th respondent has also submitted that the petitioner has not produced evidence to establish that the 8th respondent caused contamination of groundwater, as alleged in the petition. I cannot agree with this submission since the reports marked \u201cP13\u201d to \u201cP21\u201d produced by the petitioner confirm oil contamination of groundwater in the Chunnakam",

But, that fact alone does not warrant a dismissal of the petitioner\u201fs application. It is also pertinent to note that the quality of groundwater in the Chunnakam area has shown a trend of improving after the operations of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station were suspended by the Magistrate\u201fs Court in January 2015. The 8th respondent has tendered a copy of the \u201cEmergency (Generation of Electrical Power and Energy) Regulations 1 of 1997\u201d made under Section 5 of the Public Security Ordinance. This regulation declares that the provisions of, inter alia, the National Environmental Act shall be of no force or effect in so far as they relate to the generation of power and energy. The 8th respondent has submitted that, by operation of this regulation, there was no need for an EIAR at the time of setting up and commencing the generation of power at the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station. There is no merit in this contention since, as determined earlier, the addition of power generation capacity to the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station occurred sometime in 2012 and the State of Emergency ended before that, in September 2011. Thus, by 2012, this Emergency Regulation had lapsed, if it had not been revoked or lapsed earlier. Will the continued operation of the 8th respondent\u2019s thermal power station cause further pollution of groundwater in the Chunnakam area ? As mentioned earlier, the level of oil contamination of groundwater in the Chunnakam area has shown a trend of declining from 2012 onwards. The material before us, including the most recent Inspection Report dated 14th July 2017 prepared by the BOI and marked \u201cX4\u201d, establishes that there are Centrifugal Separators, a Skimmer, Oil Gravity Separation Tanks, Oil Traps, Pumps and a Sludge Tank now installed in the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station to collect waste oil and sludge and also that oil contaminated wastewater is treated before being discharged. It has also been established that the 8th respondent has, in recent years, sold its waste oil to third parties. Wastewater generated during the course of the operation of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station now appears to be in conformity with the Tolerance Limits specified in the EPL marked \u201cP23\u201d. This is confirmed by the test report marked \u201c10R12\u201d issued by the NBRO which tested a sample of wastewater obtained from the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station on 20th June 2014 and found it to be in conformity with the relevant Tolerance Limits. In these circumstances, it can be reasonably concluded that the resumption of operations of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station [which have been suspended",

Orders It has previously been held that the CEA and BOI have violated the fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution to the residents of the Chunnakam area and the petitioner [as a member of the public]. A declaration to that effect is hereby made. The petitioner has prayed for an order from this Court directing that the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station must cease all operations. I do not think that such an order would be justified or reasonable at this stage in view of the conclusion that the resumption of operations of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station is unlikely to cause further contamination or pollution of the surrounding environs provided the conditions referred to above are met. Further, the permanent shutting down of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station would be unwise and also irresponsible in the light of the prevailing need for additional electrical power generating capacity to service the demands of the National Grid. However, the 8th respondent is permitted to resume operating its thermal power station provided adequate measures are taken to ensure that doing so would not cause contamination or pollution of the surrounding environs, except as may be permitted by a duly issued EPL. Accordingly, I direct that the 8th respondent is permitted to resume operation of its thermal power station upon obtaining an EPL and a SWML from the BOI and/or CEA and subject to the 8th respondent\u201fs strict adherence to the terms and conditions stipulated in that EPL and SWML, the National Environmental Act and the regulations made thereunder.

The members of the panel and the institutions they represent shall be collectively and individually responsible for the integrity of that process. One month prior to commencing the process of distributing this sum of Rs. 20 million among the residents of the Chunnakam area, the panel shall give sufficient notice of the proposed process to the residents of the area within a 1.5 kilometre radius of the 8th respondent\u201fs thermal power station, through the Grama Niladhari Divisions in the area. The distribution of this sum of Rs. 20 million among the residents of the Chunnakam area shall be subject to the condition that only the chief occupant of a household is entitled to be paid out of these monies and that the maximum sum payable to one person is Rs.40,000/-. I direct the aforesaid panel to ascertain, with reasonable certainty, that the persons to whom monies are paid are persons whose wells have been contaminated with Oil and Grease and/or BTEX This mechanism will enable at least 500 residents of the area to be compensated, at least in part, for the loss and damage they have suffered as the result of the oil contamination of groundwater in the Chunnakam area. It is possible that the number of residents who have suffered such loss and damage may exceed 500. Therefore, I direct the panel to ensure that the sum of Rs. 20 million is divided equitably on the basis that the worst affected wells are to be given priority when distributing the payment. The 8th respondent will pay costs which may be incurred for the work of this panel.",
