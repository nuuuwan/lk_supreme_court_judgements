As mentioned above the learned District Judge as well as the learned High Court judges have refused to accept this new stance of the Defendant - Petitioner. As correctly pointed out by the learned High Court judges, an admitted fact needs no further proof-vide section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Thus, mere approval of the Divisional Secretary is not sufficient to pass the title to the Defendant - Petitioner but a corresponding disposal by the owner of the holding is needed. This court further observes that V1 is a permission addressed to the Defendant - Petitioner and not to the Plaintiff - Respondent. Even if it is considered for the sake of argument that V2 was proved (V2 was marked subject to proof and it was never put to the Plaintiff - Respondent when she was giving evidence. No step had been taken to send it to the examiner of questioned document or to list a witness acquainted with the plaintiff - Respondent\u2019s signature to prove the Plaintiff - Respondent\u2019s signature. Thus, in fact it was not a proved document) and V1 was an approval or permission given on a request made by the plaintiff. There is no evidence to show that the plaintiff - Respondent, who became the owner as per the provisions of the ordinance, conveyed title of the holding or any portion of it to the Defendant - Petitioner.",

The said statement has to be understood as one made in relation to the document marked V1 as it follows a reference made to the said document. There is no provision in the Ordinance that allows the divisional secretary to carry out or order a subdivision through a letter similar to V1. The divisional Secretary can only give permission. It is the owner who should do the subdivision with the permission of the Divisional secretary and dispose such portions of the land when there is a valid grant. On the other hand, it is only when a grant is cancelled as aforesaid the authorities get the power to issue a new grant or grants for subdivided portions of the holding alienated by the previous grant. A careful perusal of the provisions indicates that the Ordinance discourage subdivisions of the holding and disposal of subdivided portions can only be done with the approval or permission of the relevant authority.",
