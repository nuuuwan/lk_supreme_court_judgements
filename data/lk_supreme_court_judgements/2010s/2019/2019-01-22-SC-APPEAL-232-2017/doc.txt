ARGUED & DECIDED ON : 22.01.2019

Sisira J. de Abrew, Acting CJ.

Heard both Counsel in support of their respective

cases.

This is an appeal against the Judgment of the Civil

Appellate High Court dated 04.09.2012 wherein the learned Judges of the

Civil Appellate High Court dismissed the Plaintiffs’ action and also

dismissed the cross claim of the Defendant.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as Plaintiff-Appellants) have

appealed to this Court.

SC. Appeal No. 232/2017

Learned District Judge by his judgment dated

19.07.2009 held the case in favour of the Plaintiff-Appellants and ordered

them to pay Rs.100,000/-(Rupees One Hundred Thousand) as

compensation for the improvements done to the relevant house by the

Defendant.

This Court by its order dated 24.11.2017 granted leave

to appeal on questions of law set out in paragraph 9 (a), (b) and (f) of the

petition of appeal dated 12.10.2012 which are stated below:-

1. Did the Provincial High Court err and/or misdirect itself in

law by failing to appreciate that the Petitioners’ cause of

action was for ejection of the Respondent on the basis of

termination of leave and licence?

2. Did the Provincial High Court err and/or misdirect itself in

law by concluding that a declaration of title essential to

maintain the Petitioners’ action?

3. Did the Provincial High Court err and/or misdirect itself in

law by failing to appreciate that the sketch marked “P2”

annexed to the Plaint was sufficient compliance with

Sections 40 and 41 of the Civil Procedure Code?

Learned District Judge by his judgment decided that

the Defendant-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

SC. Appeal No. 232/2017

4

Defendant-Respondent) was a licensee of the Plaintiff. Learned Judges of

the Civil Appellate High Court too in their judgment concluded that the

Defendant-Respondent was a licensee of the Plaintiff.

We note that the Defendant-Respondent has failed to

appeal to this Court against the said judgment. Therefore, he has

admitted the fact that he was a licensee of the Plaintiff.

The learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court

had dismissed the Plaintiff’s action on the basis that the Plaintiff has failed

to set out an averment asking for declaration of title. But, we note that

the issue No. 01 raised by the Plaintiff to the effect that whether the

Plaintiff was the owner of the land described (Wanarajah Estate) in the

Plaint. There was no objection raised to this issue. Therefore the trial in

the District Court has proceeded on the issue whether the Plaintiff was

the owner of the land. The learned District Judge was duty bound to

answer the said issue. The learned District Judge has answered the above

issue in the affirmative.

Therefore when the learned Civil Appellate High Court

Judges decided to dismiss the Plaintiff’s action on the basis that the

Plaintiff had not asked for a declaration of title, the said conclusion, in

our view, is wrong.

SC. Appeal No. 232/2017

Now the question that must be decided is whether the

Defendant-Respondent who is a licensee is entitled to claim the plea of

prescription.

In finding an answer to the above question, I am

guided by Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance which reads as

follows:-

“No tenant of immovable property, or person claiming through such tenant,

shall during the continuance of the tenancy, be permitted to deny that the

landlord of such tenant had, at the beginning of the tenancy, a title to such

immovable property; and

no person who came upon any immovable property by the licence of the

person in possession thereof shall be permitted to deny that such person

had a title to such possession at the time when such licence was given.”

I am further guided by the judicial decisions of this

Court on this question.

In the case of De Soysa v. Fonseka, 58 NLR, page 501, this Court held

as follows:-

“When a user of immovable property commences with leave and licence the

presumption is that its continuance rests on the permission originally

granted. Clear and unmistakable evidence of the commencement of an

adverse user thereafter for the prescriptive period is necessary to entitle the

licensee to claim a servitude in respect of the premises.”

SC. Appeal No. 232/2017

In the case of Siyaneris v. Jayasinghe Udenis de Silva, 52 NLR page

289 Privy Council held as follows:-

“If a person goes into possession of land as an agent for another,

prescription does not begin to run until he has made it manifest that he is

holding adversely to his principal.”

In the case of Reginald Fernando vs. Pabilinahamy and others 2005

1SLR page 31, this Court observes the following facts:-

“The plaintiff-appellant (“the plaintiff”) instituted action against the

original defendant (“the defendant”) for ejectment from a cadjan shed

where the defendant and his father had resided for four decades. The

evidence proved that the defendant’s father J was the carter under the

plaintiff’s father. After the death of J the defendant continued to reside in

the shed as a licensee. On 22.03.1981 the plaintiff had the land surveyed

by a surveyor; and on 06.01.1987 sent a letter to the defendant through an

attorney-at-law calling upon the defendant to hand over the vacant

possession of the shed which as per the said letter the defendant had been

occupying as a licensee. The defendant failed to reply that letter without

good reason for the default. The defendant also falsely claimed not to have

been aware of the survey of the land. In the meantime the plaintiff had

been regularly collecting the produce of the land. The defendant claimed

prescriptive title to the land. The District Judge gave judgment for the

plaintiff. This was reversed by the Court of Appeal.”

This Court held as follows:-

SC. Appeal No. 232/2017

7

“Where the Plaintiff (licensor) established that the Defendant was a licensee,

the Plaintiff is entitled to take steps for ejectment of the Defendant whether

or not Plaintiff was the owner of the land.

The Court of Appeal erred in holding that the District

Court had entered judgment in favour of the Plaintiff in the absence of

sufficient evidence to prove that the Plaintiff was either the owner or that the

Defendant was his licensee”.

I would also like to consider the judicial decision in

Ruberu and Another v Wijesooriya 1998 1SLR page 58 wherein

Justice Gunawardane held as follows:-

“Whether it is a licensee or lessee, the question of title is foreign to a suit in

ejectment against either. The licensee (defendant-respondent) obtaining

possession is deemed to obtain it upon the terms that he will not dispute the

title of the plaintiff-appellant without whose permission he would not have

got it. The effect of Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance is that if a

licensee desires to challenge the title under which he is in occupation he

must first quit the land. The fact that the licensee or the lessee obtained

possession from the plaintiff-respondent is perforce an admission of the fact

that the title resides in the plaintiff.”

When we examine the evidence of the Defendant-

Respondent, we can come to the conclusion that the Defendant-

Respondent in his evidence has admitted that the Plaintiff is the owner of

the land. The Plaintiff-Appellants, by letter marked P5 dated 30.04.2004,

has terminated the leave and licence granted to the Defendant-

Respondent. Applying the principles laid down in the above judicial

SC. Appeal No. 232/2017

8

decisions, I hold that when a person starts possessing an immovable

property with leave and licence of the owner, the presumption is that he

continues to possess the immovable property on the permission originally

granted and such a person or his agents or heirs cannot claim

prescriptive title against the owner or his heirs on the basis of the period

he possessed the property.

For the above reasons we hold that the Defendant-

Respondent is not entitled to claim prescriptive title in this case. We have

earlier held that the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court were

wrong when they rejected the Plaintiff’s case.

For the above reasons we answer the 2nd question of

law as follows:-

“Since the Plaintiff-Appellants have raised an issue whether the Plaintiff-

Appellants are the owner of the land in dispute, Provincial High Court has

erred on this matter. Therefore the 2nd question of law is answered in the

affirmative. The 1st question of law is also answered in the affirmative.

The 3rd question of law does not arise for consideration.”

For the above reasons, we set aside the judgment of

the Civil Appellate High Court and affirm the judgment of the learned

District Judge.

The learned President’s Counsel appearing for the

Plaintiff-Appellants submits that the Plaintiff-Appellants are prepared to

pay Rs.100,000/= (Rupees One Hundred Thousand) ordered by the

learned District Judge to the Defendant- Respondent.

Appeal allowed.
