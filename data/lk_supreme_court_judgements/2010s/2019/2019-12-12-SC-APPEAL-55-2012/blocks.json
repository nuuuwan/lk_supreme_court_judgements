He then refers to Regulation 24 of the `Crown Lands Regulations,1948\u2019 made by the Minister under the provisions of the State Lands Ordinance and draws our attention to the subsequent Order dated 22nd August 1949 made by the Governor-General under section 105 of the Ordinance read with Regulation 24 and published in Government Gazette No. 10,103 dated 02nd September 1949. Senior State Counsel states that, by this Order, the Governor-General has delegated his power to lease State Land to, inter alia, the Government Agent of an Administrative District. In this connection, learned Senior State Counsel states \u201cGazette No 10,103 dated 02nd September 1949 contains the order dated 22nd August 1949 marked WS2 issued by the Secretary to the Governor General and the Schedule under column II (b) lists the Government Agent and gives the power in Clause (2) of section 2 to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of Crown Land\u201d. Senior State Counsel goes on to submit that, following the enactment of the Transfer of Powers [Divisional Secretaries] Act No. 58 of 1992, that delegated power conferred on a Government Agent to lease State Land under the provisions of the State Lands Ordinance, is now vested in the Divisional Secretary of the relevant Divisional Secretariat. On that basis, learned Senior State Counsel states \u201cThus it is clear that the Divisional Secretary has the power to Lease State Land\u201d. Next, he points out that it is admitted that the land in issue is situated within the Divisional Secretariat of Nuwaragam Palatha - East. Thus, learned Senior State Counsel concludes by submitting that, in terms of the aforesaid provisions of law, Regulation 24 of the Crown Lands Regulations,1948 and the Governor-General\u2019s Order dated 22nd August 1949 referred to above, the Divisional Secretary of Nuwaragam Palatha - East [ie: the 1st respondent] had the power and authority to lawfully issue the writing marked \u201cP14\u201d authorising the 2nd respondent to occupy the land pending the issue of a formal `lease permit\u2019 [\u201c\u0db6\u0daf\u0dd4 \u0db6\u0dbd\u0db4\u0dad\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dba\u201d] and subject to payment of a lease rental.

It is also evident from a reading of the Order that any \u201cconditions and limitations\u201d placed on that delegation would be specified in Column III of that Schedule. Consequently, the fact that Column III of Items 1 and 4 of the Schedule has been left blank, establishes that no \u201cconditions and limitations\u201d have been placed on the delegation, to Government Agents, of the power, functions and duties vested in the Governor-General by section 2 (2) and section 2 (3) of the Ordinance to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of State Land or to enter into agreements for the sale, lease or other disposition of State Land.

These three Orders are: the Order dated 10th July 1950 published in Government Gazette No. 10,127 dated 21st July 1950, the Order dated 11th October 1962 published in Government Gazette No. 13,354 dated 19th October 1962 and the Order dated 25th November 1964 published in Government Gazette No. 14,569 dated 26th November 1965. These subsequent Orders deal with the delegation of the Governor-General\u2019s powers, in specified circumstances, to the Gal Oya Development Board, to the General Manager of Railways or Lands Officer of the Railway Department and to the Commanders of the Security Forces, respectively. These subsequent Orders are not relevant to the present appeal. I have also seen another Order dated 22nd August 1949 published in Government Gazette No. 10,013 dated 02nd September 1949. That Order deals with specified aspects of the Definition of Boundaries Ordinance No. 01 of 1844, as amended, and the Land Development Ordinance. It is also not relevant to the present appeal. Our attention has not been drawn to any other Orders made under the State Lands Ordinance. It is also relevant to state here that the term \u201cGovernment Agent\u201d for the purposes of the State Lands Ordinance has been defined in section 110 (1) of the Ordinance to include Additional or Assistant Government Agents and \u201cany other prescribed officer\u201d. Further, the additional Regulation made by the Minister on 22nd October 1963, which I mentioned earlier, specifies that any District Land Officer is also a \u201cprescribed officer\u201d",

    "text": "who is to be regarded as a Government Agent for the purposes of the Ordinance. That position is also mentioned Item 189 (4) in Chapter III of the Land Manual. Before parting with the Regulations and Orders made under the State Lands Ordinance, it may be said in passing that a comparison of Regulation 4 (2) read with the Second Schedule of the Crown Lands Regulations, 1948, on one hand, and Regulation 24 (2) read with the Third Schedule of the same Regulations, on the other hand, raises something of an anomaly. That is because, as set out above: Regulation 4 (2) read with Item 4 of the Second Schedule contemplates that, in the event of the Governor-General delegating his powers under the Ordinance, a Government Agent would \u201csign and execute\u201d an instrument of disposition of State Land including those made under sections 2 (2), 2 (3) and 2 (4) of the Ordinance only in respect of State Land which is in his charge and that any such instrument of disposition can only be for a period not exceeding five years; however, Regulation 24 (2) read with Items 1and 2 of the Third Schedule provides that the Governor-General is entitled to delegate to the Government Agent, the entirety of the powers, duties and authority vested in the Governor-General by sections 2 (2), 2 (3) and 2 (4) of the State Lands Ordinance, without any limitation with regard to the location of the State Land or the period of any such instrument of disposition. Thereafter, although Items 1, 4 and 6 in the Schedule to the aforesaid Order dated 22nd August 1949 state that the Governor-General has delegated his powers under sections 2 (2) and 2 (3) of the Ordinance to Government Agents without any restriction and delegated his powers under sections 2 (4) of the Ordinance to Government Agents without any restriction as to period of the permit, it has to be kept in mind that section 105 of the Ordinance empowers the Governor-General to delegate his powers, duties and authorities only \u201cin such cases as may be prescribed\u201d by the Minister. Consequently, since Regulation 4 (2) read with Item 4 of the Second Schedule to the Crown Lands Regulations, 1948 specifically prescribes that a Government Agent could sign and execute an instrument of disposition only in respect of State Land which is in his charge and that any such instrument of disposition can only be for a period not exceeding five years, it appears that, the aforesaid delegation, made by the Order dated 22nd August 1949, of the Governor-General\u2019s powers under sections 2 (2), 2 (3) and 2 (4) of the State Lands Ordinance to Government Agents, would have to be read as being subject to the prescribed restriction that the power and authority to sign and execute an instrument of disposition was delegated to a Government Agent only in respect of State Land which is in his charge and subject to the restriction that any such instrument of disposition could only be for a period not exceeding five years. This is said",

    "text": "only by way of an observation as this question does not arise for determination in the present appeal. The next step is to look at the Transfer of Powers [Divisional Secretaries] Act, No. 58 of 1992 which is referred to by learned Senior State Counsel. By way of background, it should be mentioned that, prior to the enactment of this statute, there were several Assistant Government Agent Divisions, each headed by an Assistant Government Agent, within each of the Administrative Districts of Sri Lanka. The administrative head of the public service in each Administrative District was the Government Agent. The Assistant Government Agents of each Division within the District, reported to the Government Agent. Section 2 of the aforesaid Act, empowered the Minister to establish Divisional Secretaries\u2019 Divisions within each Administrative District. In practice, these Divisional Secretaries Divisions broadly corresponded with the previous Assistant Government Agent Divisions. Section 3 (1) of the same Act specified that each Divisional Secretaries Division shall be assigned a Divisional Secretary. Next, section 4 (1) of the Act provided, inter alia, that wherever the words \u201cGovernment Agent\u201d occur in any written law or in any notice, permit, instrument or document issued, made, required, executed or authorised by or under any written law, such words \u201cshall be substituted therefor\u201d by the expression \"the Divisional Secretary of the Divisional Secretary's Division\". Thus, by the enactment of the Transfer of Powers [Divisional Secretaries] Act, the powers, functions and duties vested in Government Agents and Assistant Government Agents within a newly created Divisional Secretaries Division, were vested in the Divisional Secretary of that Division.",

It should next be mentioned that Article 21 (h) of Republican Constitution of 1972 declared that the President had the power and function of making and executing grants and dispositions of State Land under the Public Seal. However, section 21 of the State Lands Ordinance specifically declares that an instrument of disposition under the Ordinance \u201cneed not be issued under the Public Seal of the Island except in such cases and in such instances as may be prescribed\u201d. A perusal of the State Lands Ordinance and the Crown Lands Regulations, 1948 shows no instance where it has been prescribed that the Public Seal is to be placed on any type of instrument of disposition made under the Ordinance. Consequently, it would appear that Article 21 (h) of the Republican Constitution of 1972 would not have affected the validity of the aforesaid",

Silva J [as he then was] issued the interim order stating [at p.45] \u201cCertainly, there is no provision in the Crown Lands Ordinance or the Regulations made there under that empower the Secretary to take administrative action to place any party in possession of state land pending grant of a lease. Such action militates against the provisions of Regulation 21 (2) which requires a notice to be published inviting objections. No useful purpose will be served by such a Regulation if the Secretary could arrogate to himself the power to place a private party in possession of state land pending the completion of statutory procedures.\u201d. No doubt, the fact that the requirements of Regulation 21 (2) of the Crown Lands Regulations, 1948 had not been complied with, loomed large in that decision of the Court of Appeal. But, the observation by Silva J that there is no provision in the State Lands Ordinance which authorises a prescribed officer to place an intended lessee in possession of State Land pending the signing and execution of the lease, would hold true with regard to any instrument of disposition made under section 2 of the State Lands Ordinance.",
