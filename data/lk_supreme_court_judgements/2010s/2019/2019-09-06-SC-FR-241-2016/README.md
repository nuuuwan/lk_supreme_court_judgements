DECIDED ON : 06th September 2019.

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The Petitioner i.e. Ponnaiya Sivagnanam, is an Arts Graduate and was appointed as a

graduate teacher of the Sri Lanka Teachers Service and has been teaching at

Methodist College since 2010, which is a school under the purview of the Western

Province Educational Ministry. The Petitioner has filed this Application before us,

alleging that his fundamental rights under Articles 11, 12(1), 12(2) and 14(1)(g) of the

Constitution have been infringed by the Respondents and leave was granted on

19.10.2017 in terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The facts of the case, in the chronological order, have been produced as follows for

completeness.

The Petitioner was first appointed as a graduate teacher in 1993 to Al Naser Maha

Vidyalayam, Colombo 14. He was, later, transferred to the Mutwal Hindu College,

Colombo 15, where he served from 1997 to 2004. Following this, he was transferred to

St. Johnes College, Colombo 15, where he served from 2004 to 2010 June. The

Petitioner has not disputed the aforementioned transfers.

In June 2010, the Petitioner was transferred to Kotahena Methodist Tamil Vidyalayam,

Colombo 13. The Petitioner, during his early days at the school, wrote to various

authorities about the alleged mismanagement and misappropriation of the school

resources by the then Principal of Kotahena Methodist Tamil Vidyalayam (hereinafter

referred to as the 7th Respondent). On 12th May 2016, the Petitioner received a

transfer letter to Mutwal Hindu College (hereinafter referred to as the First Transfer of

Dispute). The Petitioner made an appeal to the Zonal Director of Education

(hereinafter referred to as the 5th Respondent), protesting the said transfer and

instead requested Kalaimagal Tamil Vidyalayam, Colombo 14, since there was an

English teaching vacancy in the said school. Awaiting further notice from the 5th

SC/ FR/ 241/2016 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 11

Respondent, the Petitioner intended to continue at the Methodist College, but the 7th

Respondent objected to the Petitioner signing in the Register and therefore, the

Petitioner requested duty leave until the transfer was corrected.

On 31.05.2016, the Petitioner received a further transfer letter to Fathima Muslim

Ladies College, Colombo 12 (hereinafter referred to as the Second Transfer of

Dispute). When the Petitioner reported at the said school, the Principal had refused

from permitting the Petitioner to sign in the Register stating that as a long standing

policy, the School has had only Lady Teachers. The Petitioner had informed the 5th

Respondent of the same and had requested duty leave. Thereafter, on 06.06.2016, the

Petitioner along with a Teachers Union Representative had pleaded with the Zonal

Director to cancel the transfer and in the alternative, the Petitioner had appealed for a

school in Kotahena, where there was a vacancy for a teacher of English.

On 15.06.2016, the Petitioner received a transfer letter to St. Anthonys Tamil

Vidyalayam, Madampitiya, Colombo 15 (hereinafter referred to as the Third Transfer

of Dispute), but when the Petitioner reported for duty, the Principal of St. Anthonys

Tamil Vidyalayam (hereinafter referred to as the 8th Respondent) refused the

Petitioners presence there. The Petitioner complained to the Deputy Zonal Director of

Education (hereinafter referred to as the 6th Respondent), who gave him a letter

dated 22.06.2016 (document marked as P12) addressing the 8th Respondent, seeking

the 8th Respondent to inform the Zonal Director if he does not accept the transfer of

the Petitioner. The directive was disregarded by the 8th Respondent.

On the same day, the Petitioner handed over a letter to the 6th Respondent,

(document marked as P13) who then gave the Petitioner a letter addressing the 7th

Respondent (document marked as P14), seeking the 7th Respondent to permit the

Petitioner to continue in Kotahena Methodist Tamil Vidyalayam, Colombo 13.

The Petitioner, along with the said letter marked P14 reported to Kotahena Methodist

Tamil Vidyalayam on 23.06.2016, where the 7th Respondent over a phone call to the 6th

Respondent, refused the Petitioner and sought other solutions.

SC/ FR/ 241/2016 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 11

On 11.07.2016, the Petitioner by letter, was directed to report to St. Anthonys Tamil

Vidyalayam, again. When the Petitioner reported there, the 8th Respondent refused his

reporting at the school.

Thereafter, the Petitioner has filed the present Application before this Court and leave

was granted on 19.10.2017 in terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Having produced the facts of this Application as submitted by the learned Counsel for

the Petitioners and agreed to by the learned Counsel for the Respondents, I now turn

to consider the grievance of the Petitioners and the corresponding contentions of the

Respondents.

Contentions of the parties on the First Transfer of Dispute

In paragraph 8 of the Petition dated 21.07.2016 (hereinafter referred to as the

Petition), the Petitioner contends that he had protested the first transfer since he had

already served in Mutwal Hindu College between 1997-2004 and alleges that the

transfer was contrary to the National Transfer Policy of Teachers Circular No. 2007/20

dated 13.12.2007.

In response to these averments, in the Affidavit of the 5th(a) Respondent dated

24.08.2018 (hereinafter referred to as the Affidavit of the Respondent), it has been

stated in paragraph 8, that the transfer was due to the need to balance the teachers

available in the zone, as there was vacancy in Mutwal Hindu College and that the

transfer had been done in accordance with paragraph 8:2 of the Education Ministry

Circular 1/2016.

Contentions of the parties on the Second Transfer of Dispute

In paragraph 10 of the Affidavit of the Respondent, it has been stated that the

Principal of Fathima Muslim Ladies College objected to the Petitioner being

transferred there.

SC/ FR/ 241/2016 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 11

The Petitioner has contended in paragraph 10 of the Petition that he had objected to

the transfer but had reported there for the purpose of continuing duty.

Contentions of the parties on the Third Transfer of Dispute

The Petitioner, in paragraph 16 of the Petition has, in terms of the third transfer, stated

that, the treatment by the Principal is due to the influences of the 7th Respondent.

Further, the Petitioner, in paragraphs 18 and 20, has inter alia, described the transfer

procedure as indiscriminate, unlawful, unfair and illegal.

The Respondents, in paragraph 16 of the affidavit, have stated that the Petitioner by

his conduct, had demonstrated that he is having difficulty in getting on with the

Principals of schools. Moreover, it has been stated in paragraph 17 of the affidavit that,

the transfers were all made within the Colombo North Division of the Zone and that

other teachers were also transferred.

With regard to the above contentions of the parties, I make the following

observations.

In order to constitute an infringement under Article 12(1), there must have been a

discriminatory action or an arbitrary action that amounts to a denial of equal

treatment or equal protection of the law.

In the case of Perera v. Jayawickrema (1985) 1 Sri L.R. 285, it was observed that-

Discrimination can exist only where two persons or two subjects are

treated in different ways. It arises only from two dissimilar treatments

and not from similar treatments.

Therefore, the existence of discrimination mandates dissimilar treatment of similar

persons or subjects. I observe that, the petitioner along with other teachers were

transferred in order to balance the teachers available in the zone. Therefore, I find that,

the Petitioner has not been treated differently from persons who have been similarly

circumstanced.

SC/ FR/ 241/2016 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 11

Having eliminated the possibility of differential treatment, I now, find it apposite to

consider the ground of arbitrariness under Article 12(1).

In the case of Perera v. Monetary Board of the Central Bank and Ors. (1994) 1 Sri

L.R. 152, with regard to promotion/recruitment in the public sector, it was observed

that-

Persons are entitled to complain if they were invidiously or

arbitrarily treated by or in the selection process

The meaning of arbitrariness with regard to the principles enumerated in Article 12(1)

can be understood from the interpretation of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution.

In the case of Sharma Transport v. Government of A.P. (2002) 2 SCC 188, it was

observed-

The expression arbitrarily means: in an unreasonable manner, as

fixed or done capriciously or at pleasure, without adequate determining

principle, not founded in the nature of things, non-rational, not done or

acting according to reason or judgment, depending on the will alone.

(Emphasis added)

In the case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248, it was observed-

The principle of reasonableness, which legally and philosophically, is

an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades

Article 14 like a brooding omnipresence.

(Emphasis added)

The above view was re-iterated in the case of R.D. Shetty v. International Airport

Authority, (1979) 3 SCC 489-

SC/ FR/ 241/2016 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 11

The principle of reasonableness and rationality which is legally as well

as philosophically an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness

is protected by Article 14 and it must characterise every State action,

whether it be under authority of law or in exercise of executive power

without making of law.

Therefore, it is clear that reasonableness is an essential element of non-arbitrariness.

Considering the facts of the case, I find that the transfer had been done in accordance

with paragraph 8:2 of the Education Ministry Circular 1/2016 and the transfers were all

within the Colombo North Division of the Zone, for the purpose of balancing the

teachers. Therefore, I find that the procedure adopted was reasonable and within the

ambit of the prescribed law. Owing to the presence of reasonableness, the transfer

procedure becomes non-arbitrary.

In addition to the aforementioned findings, I find it pertinent to make the following

observations.

The Petitioner, at the time of the first transfer of dispute, had protested the transfer

and requested Kalaimagal Tamil Vidyalayam, Colombo 14, since there was an English

teaching vacancy in the said school. Moreover, it is clear from the contents of the

Petition that the Petitioner has, since the time of the first transfer, had objections

against each of his transfers, even before he could report to the newly assigned work

place.

All the transfers that the Petitioner has disputed was well within the zone in very close

proximity and were done in accordance with the National Transfer Policy for the

purpose of balancing the teachers within the zone. Therefore, I find that the conduct

of the Respondent on disputing all of the stated transfers, reflects his intentions to

teach English, rather than arts, although he has not specialized in English.

In response to the Respondents contention that the Petitioner had difficulty in getting

along with the Principals of Schools, the Petitioner, in Paragraph 7 of the counter-

SC/ FR/ 241/2016 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 11

objections filed by him, has stated that, he is an intellectual giant and that, it is not

his conduct that is the cause for the developments that occurred. Considering these

submissions, I am of the view that, the reasons for the alleged difficult relationship

shared between the Petitioner and the Principals of Schools is not an essential issue

that has to be addressed by us for the purpose of determining an Article 12(1)

violation with regard to the disputed transfer procedure.

For the reasons already enumerated by me, I find that, the transfer procedure was just

and reasonable. Therefore, I find that, there is no violation of the Petitioners

fundamental right under Article 12(1).

Accordingly, I dismiss the Application and grant no cost.

Application dismissed.
