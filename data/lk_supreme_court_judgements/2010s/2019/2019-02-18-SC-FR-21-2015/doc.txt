Argued on: 29.11.2018

Decided on: 18.02.2019

L.T.B.Dehideniya, J.

The Petitioners invoked the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this court

challenging the failure of authorities to select them to Sri Lanka Education

Administration Service (SLEAS) Class III. Petitioners have applied for the

following cadre vacancies of SLEAS by the gazette notice bearing no: 1808

dated 26.04.2013.

5

a) Open Competitive Examination- General Cadre

b) Seniority & Merit – General Cadre

c) Limited Competitive Examination- General Cadre & Special Cadre

The Petitioners state that, they sat for the Limited Competitive Examination

on 24.11.2013 and the list of qualified candidates was displayed on the official

website of the Ministry of Education and the names of the petitioners were not

reflected therein. The Petitioners further state that they received the results of

the aforementioned examination after the interviews were being held. The

contention of the petitioners is that, they have not been called for the

interviews for the aforesaid SLEAS vacancies due to the reason of obtaining

less than 40 marks for one of the subjects at the examination which was

considered as a pre requisite.

The Petitioners state that, 16 applicants who had scored less than 40 marks for

one subject have been called for the interviews to be appointed under the

special cadre of the Limited Competitive Examination and subsequently 21

persons, including the above 16 applicants with 5 additional individuals have

been recruited and the criteria of selection was not disclosed to the public. The

Petitioners state that they have made attempts to obtain the relevant

information from the Ministry of Education but the attempts were of no avail.

The contention of the petitioners was that, the authorities have disregarded

them in making the appointments to the SLEAS vacancies and they should

have been given an opportunity to get selected. The Petitioners complain of

6

the failure of the respective authorities in being transparent, as there was no

dissemination of information in relation to the individual marks obtained by

the applicants at the interviews and still the authorities can appoint them to the

SLEAS class III, as there are over 600 vacancies. The Petitioners’ compliant

is that the non- selection and non- appointment of the petitioners to the Sri

Lanka Education Administration Service is arbitrary, irrational and

unreasonable while in violation of the Fundamental Right guaranteed to them

under the Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The procedure which is to be followed, in making appointments to Class III,

of the Sri Lanka Educational Administrative Service is depicted in the service

minute of the Sri Lanka Educational Administrative Service, published in the

Gazette Extraordinary bearing No: 1225/32 dated 1st March 2002. Clause 8 of

the Gazette Notification specifies the fact that, ‘Not more than 45% of the

vacancies in class III of the service will be made by the Committee on the

results of a Limited Competitive Examination’. Clause 10 states ‘The method

of application for the examination and fees required will be notified in the

Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka’. The applications

for the Limited Competitive Examination were called by the Gazette

Notification 1808 dated 26th April 2013. According to the Gazette Notification

1808, subjects assigned to the Special cadre are ‘English, Mathematics,

Science, Art, Music (Eastern), Music (Western), Dancing, Physical Education,

Agriculture, Commerce, Handicraft, Home Science, Special Education,

Planning, Arabic, Information Technology and Piriven’.

7

The 1A respondent admits the appointment of 21 officers to the Sri Lanka

Education Administrative Service Class III, with a reduced pass mark and the

appointments were pertaining to the subjects Physical Education, Special

Education, Dancing, Western Music, Eastern Music, and Art. The 1A

respondent further states that there were insufficient candidates and the

petitioners have not applied for the specific subjects. As per the contention of

the 1A respondent, the insinuation made by the petitioners is disingenuous and

misleading as the discussions were held prior to making the appointments.

The 1A respondent states that, the names of the 21 appointees were not

included in the list of names published on the website, as the 21 appointments

were made after deliberation and to ensure that adequate number of officers

are appointed to the specific subjects.

The 1A respondent further states that the procedure to make appointments to

class III, of SLEAS is set out in the minute of the Sri Lanka Educational

Administrative Service and published in the Gazette Extraordinary bearing

No.1225/32 dated 01st March 2002. The 1A respondent states that, the issue

which has arisen in this case is related to the decision to lower the pass mark

to 35 for the special cadre subjects of Physical Education, Special Education,

Dancing, Western Music, Eastern Music and Art and the decision of the

Public Service Commission to lower the pass mark is due to a request of the

Ministry of Education to that effect by letter dated 26th March 2014. The 1A

respondent further states, The Public Service Commission is empowered by

the Public Service Commission Procedural Rules published on Special

8

Gazette Notification bearing No.: 1589/30 dated 20th February 2009, to

deviate from the rules, regulations and procedure laid down by the

commission under exceptional circumstances subject to Article 12(1) of the

Constitution. According to the 1A respondent, the Ministry of Education has

sought the permission from the Public Service Commission to appoint 488

officers to the Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service by letter dated 05th

March 2013. Further, by a letter dated 21st November 2013, the Ministry of

Education has requested the permission to increase the number of officers to

558. The request made by the letter dated 21st November 2013 was approved

by the Public Service Commission by the response letter dated 11th December

2013. The Ministry of Education was requested to submit a subject wise

breakdown of the cadre vacancies under the limited stream, being 45% of the

total vacancies by letter dated 12th February 2014 and 13th February 2014.

Public Service Commission has requested the Department of Examinations by

letter dated 21st February 2014, to forward the result sheets of candidates, who

obtained not less than 40% in any one subject in the order of merit in respect

of the vacancies. In pursuance of the letter dated 21st February 2014,

Department of Examinations submitted the results sheets. It is evident, the

number of candidates who passed the examination were fewer than the

number of vacancies allocated for the subjects Art, Eastern Music, Western

Music, Dancing, Physical Education and Special Education, whereas in other

subjects the number of candidates who passed the examination had exceeded

the vacancies allocated. The 1A respondent further states that, the Public

Service Commission has forwarded the results sheets of 203 applicants who

9

had scored high marks, to the Ministry of Education by the letter dated 24th

February 2014, and the interviews were held on 20, 24, and 25 of March 2014.

The Ministry of Education by the letter dated 26th March 2014, has made a

request to the Public Service Commission to reduce the cut off mark of the

subjects; Art, Eastern Music, Western Music, Dancing, Physical Education

and Special Education. As per the contention of the 1A respondent, the

request was based in the interests of the exigencies of service, reasonable and

in accordance with the law. By letter dated 07th April 2014, the Public Service

Commission has approved the request of reducing the cut off mark, and

requested the Ministry of Education to reduce the pass mark to 35% and

submit the results sheets in the order of merit. The 1A respondent further

clarifies, that the vacancies in respect of Physical Education and Special

Education are 19 and 17 respectively and the subsequent increase of vacancies

was due to the fact, that during the appointing process, the Public Service

Commission did not approve all the recommendations of the ministry of

education in respect of the said subjects and consequently a higher number of

vacancies were to be approved by considering the number originally requested

by the Ministry of Education.

The subjects which the petitioners have applied are different from that of,

subjects which come under the reduced cut off mark. As the 1A respondent

illustrates, the subjects which were applied by the Petitioners as General

Cadre, Planning, Science, Mathematics, Information Technology, and

Commerce. The 1A respondent states, that 1st, 6th 7th and 9th Petitioners would

10

not benefit from the cut off mark reduced to 35%, as they have obtained less

than 35% for at least one subject. The aggregate of 3rd and 4th petitioners was

less than the aggregate cut off marks for the subjects which were applied by

them and they would not have benefited even if the individual subject wise cut

off mark was reduced to 35%. The 1A respondent further clarifies the

situation of 2nd, 5th and 8th petitioners. They have obtained more than the

aggregate cut off mark for Information Technology, Mathematics, and

General Cadre respectively but even if the pass mark is reduced to 35% across

the board, there are other candidates who had obtained more than 40% marks

in all the subjects and would not benefit the petitioners at any cost.

The 1st respondent states that, the Petitioners did not obtain more than 40% for

each of the subjects which they have applied. The 1st respondent further states

that, as there were insufficient number of candidates who have been qualified,

the vacancies for the subjects of Art, Eastern Music, Western Music, Dancing,

Physical Education and Special Education were filled by reducing the pass

mark. The contention of the respondent is that, the appointments are based on

the urgent need of SLEAS officers specializing the aforementioned subjects.

In this instance, the Respondent affirms that Public Service Commission, as

the appointing authority has an authority to deviate from rules and procedures

hence granted approval to fill the vacancies of the subjects based on the pass

mark 35%. This approval as the respondent states, is due to the urgent need of

the service.

11

The Petitioners’ complaint is that the Fundamental Right guaranteed to them

by the Article 12(1) of the Constitution is violated. As Justice Sharvananda

states ‘Equal protection means the right to equal treatment, in similar

cirmstances’. Equal treatment is considered as an important principle that any

nation can take its ideal.’(Fundamental Rights In Sri Lanka; Justice

Sharvananda 1993 pg 81) In Gulf Colorada, Co v. Ellis (1897)165 U.S.150,

it was stated, ‘It must appear that not only that a classification has been made

but also that it is one based upon some reasonable ground- some difference

which bears a just and proper relation to the attempted classification’.

(Fundamental Rights In Sri Lanka; Justice Sharvananda 1993 pg 85).Willis,

Constitutional Law 1936, defines equal protection of the law as protection of

equal laws. He states that, ‘it merely requires that all persons shall be treated

alike under like circumstances and conditions, both in the privileges conferred

and on liabilities imposed.’(Fundamental Rights In Sri Lanka; Justice

Sharvananda 1993 pg 85 &86).

The petitioners have applied for the subjects which did not undergo a

reduction of the cut off marks; General Cadre, Planning, Science,

Mathematics, Information Technology, and Commerce. The subjects relevant

to the lowered pass mark to 35%, were Physical Education, Special Education,

Dancing, Western Music, Eastern Music and Art.It is evident, that the

petitioners and 21 appointees are not similarly circumstanced. It is axiomatic,

that the law forbids the inequal treatment between equals. There is no equality

between the Petitioners and the appointees. Article 12 of the constitution

accepts the reasonable classification. As justice Sharvananda states, ‘what is

forbidden by Article 12 is invidious or hostile discrimination which is

12

arbitrary, irrational and not reasonably related to a legitimate objective’.

(Fundamental Rights In Sri Lanka; Justice Sharvananda 1993 pg. 92) The

respondents’ decision to lower the pass mark and make appointments was

solely based upon the interests of the exigencies of service. It is reasonable

and in accordance with the law.

By considering the circumstances, it is evident that no violation of the

fundamental right guaranteed to the Petitioners under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution had taken place.

Petition dismissed.
