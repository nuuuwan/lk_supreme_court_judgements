S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

This is an appeal against the order of the Provincial High Court of Balapitiya. It

will be appropriate to mention the particulars of the case. The Accused - Appellant-

Appellant namely, Meegastennage Prince Gunawardena (hereinafter referred to as the

Accused- Appellant) was charged before the Magistrate Court on two counts

punishable under Section 400 and 386 of the Penal Code respectively for committing

the offences of cheating and misappropriation of sum of Rs. 80, 000/-.

On the 20/01/1999 the Learned Magistrate had taken up the case for trial.

Prosecution led the evidence of Vendahandi Padmasiri, Vijemuni Lenton Terrance de

Soysa, and Police Sergeant Yatagama Lokuge Leelawansa and closed the case for the

prosecution. When, defence called the Accused-Appellant made a dock statement and

stated that, the allegations made against him were false. The Learned Magistrate found

the Accused- Appellant guilty on first and second counts and imposed Rs. 5000/- fine

in-default 2 months Rigorous Imprisonment and 2 years Rigorous Imprisonment for the

first count and 2 years rigorous imprisonment for the second count. Further, it was

ordered to implement both sentences concurrently.

Being aggrieved by the said order Accused- Appellant appealed to the Provincial

High Court (sitting in appeal) and raised the following questions of law.

(Sic eret scriptum)

SC Appeal 42/2014 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 8

English translations of the above grounds of appeal are as follows:

(1) when the accused does not suggest any defence, is it acceptable to convict the

accused solely based on a suggestion made by the Counsel for the Prosecution to

the Court?

(2) Is there any jurisdiction to dismiss the appeal based on evidence which was not

utilised by the Magistrate Court to convict the Accused?

The High Court Judges hearing the arguments found that, the Accused-Appellant

not guilty on the 2nd count and acquitted him. Further, found the Accused-Appellant

guilty on the first count and affirmed the sentence imposed by the Learned Magistrate

(Rs. 5000/ fine in default 2 months Rigorous Imprisonment and 2 years Rigorous

Imprisonment.)

Being dissatisfied with the order of the Learned High Court Judge the Accused-

Appellant preferred this appeal to the Supreme Court and raised the following questions

of law.

1. The Conviction solely based not on the evidence in the case, but on the

suggestions made by the defence counsel in cross-examination of the main

witness, where the accused-appellant did not take up such position.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has used the evidence which were not considered

by the Learned Magistrate to dismiss the appeal.

(Sic eret scriptum)

When the matter was taken up for argument the counsel for the Accused-

Appellant submitted that, there is no acceptable judgment by the Learned Magistrate.

Therefore, anything proceeding further becomes illegal. State Counsel initially submitted

SC Appeal 42/2014 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 8

that, the judgment is proper and acceptable. After a while, she admitted that, the

Learned Magistrate has not pronounced the judgment with reasons and sought to send

the case for re-trial.

The facts of the case as per the submissions of the Counsels and the available

evidence are as follows. It is alleged that, the Accused-Appellant had obtained Rs.

80,000/- from the First Prosecution Witness to send him to Malaysia to seek an

employment as a driver. PW1 was sent to Malaysia and employed on casual basis to one

"Upali". After about 8 months, the Accused- Appellant had made a forged visa with the

help of Upali and entered to Singapore, where he was arrested and detained. After his

deportation to Sri Lanka, he lodged a complaint at the Police Station of Kosgoda against

the Accused-Appellant and he was charged under section 400 and 386 of the Penal

Code for cheating and Criminal Misappropriation. After the trial, on the 17/11/1999 the

Accused-Appellant was found guilty and on the 03/05/2000 and the Learned Magistrate

imposed the sentences. The relevant Journal Entry is reproduced for clear reference.

English translation of the above paragraph as follows:

2000/05/03

Accused- M. Prince Gunawardena.

I impose a fine of Rs. 5000/- for the first count in default 2 months rigorous

imprisonment. In addition, I impose 2 years rigorous imprisonment.

Two years

I impose 2 years rigorous imprisonment for the second count. I order that, both

sentences run concurrently.

(Emphasis the Magistrate)

When the matter was taken up in the appeal before the High Court of Balapitiya

the Learned High Court Judge almost re-written the Judgment and found the Accused-

Appellant guilty for the first count and acquitted him on the second count. The Learned

High Court Judge affirmed the sentence imposed by the Magistrate on the first count.

The first count is under Sec.400 of the Penal Code and it states as follows.

Punishment for cheating-Whoever cheats shall be punished with imprisonment of

either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with

both.

(Emphasis added)

Maximum sentence spelled out in the law is one year and the sentence imposed

by the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge is patently wrong because,

the Court has no jurisdiction to impose the said sentence.

Further, under Section 14 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979

the Learned Magistrate has no jurisdiction to impose the said fine. Hence, the fine

SC Appeal 42/2014 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 8

imposed by the Learned Magistrate and affirming the sentence by Learned High Court

Judge is bad in law.

Article 13(4) of the Constitution of the Republic states as follows: -

"No person shall be punished with death or imprisonment except by order of a

competent Court, made in accordance with the procedure established by law."

For the purpose of completeness, I wish to consider the facts, order of the

learned Magistrate and learned High Court Judge to determine the questions of law

raised before this Court. It is alleged that the Accused- Appellant had obtained Rs.

80,000/- to get an employment to First Prosecution Witness in Malaysia. PW1 was sent

to Malaysia. There, he worked with Upali for about 8 months, made a forged long term

visa and entered Singapore. There he was arrested, detained and deported to Sri Lanka.

On return he complained to the Police and they preferred charges against the Accused-

Appellant under section 400 and 386 of the Penal Code for Cheating and Criminal

Misappropriation respectively.

The Learned Magistrate found the Accused-Appellant guilty for both counts and

imposed sentences as stated above. When the matter was appealed to the High Court,

the High Court found the Accused- Appellant guilty for the first count and affirmed the

sentence and acquitted him on the second count.

Order of the learned Magistrate was discussed by the learned High Court Judge

and she had not accepted or denied the said order. Further, she had not given

reasonable reasons for re-writing the judgment. Anyhow, I considered the available

reasoning given by the learned High Court Judge, where she had found the Accused-

Appellant guilty under section 400 of the Penal Code for cheating. But, the learned High

Court Judge had not considered proof of ingredients of the charge of cheating. She had

merely narrated selected portions of the evidence and decided that, the case is proved.

SC Appeal 42/2014 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 8

It is mandatory for the Judge to analyze the entire evidence before the Court and

to find whether the ingredients are proved beyond reasonable doubt. But, in this case

neither the Magistrate nor the High Court Judge had followed the basic evaluation of

facts and standard of proof. It is also noted that the both the Magistrate and High Court

Judge had not properly analysed the dock statement.

As stated above, I am of the view that, there is no case proved against the

Accused-Appellant beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, finding of the Accused- Appellant

guilty is unacceptable.

Considering all, I find that, the conviction is not supported by the Evidence before

the Court therefore; I do not incline to uphold the conviction. For the reasons stated

above I find that, the sentence is bad in law. Accordingly, I allow the appeal and find the

Accused-Appellant not guilty and make an order to acquit him.

Appeal allowed.
