ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 24.01.2019.

SISIRA J. DE ABREW, ACTING CJ.

The Petitioner by his petition dated 15.11.2017 has complained to this Court

that his fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) have been infringed by

the 1st Respondent when she (the 1st Respondent) refused to admit the

Petitioner’s child to Vishaka Vidyalaya, Colombo. This Court by its order dated

28.03.2018 granted Leave to Proceed for the alleged violation of Article 12(1) of

the Constitution.

Petitioner made an application to Vishaka Vidyalaya, Colombo to admit his

child to Grade I. However, the Principal of Vishaka Vidyalaya (the 1st

Respondent) refused the admission of the said child to the Vishaka Vidyalaya.

Thereafter, on an appeal made by the Petitioner to the Secretary to the Ministry

of Education (the 2nd Respondent) in terms of circular marked P1, the said

Secretary made an order that the petitioner’s child should be admitted to

Grade I in Vishaka Vidyalaya in the year 2014. This document has been

marked as P7 by the Petitioner. However, the 1st Respondent made an

endorsement on the said letter marked P7 as a suggestion to the 2nd

SC.FR.NO.414/2017

Respondent that she would admit the Petitioner’s child to Grade II in Vishaka

Vidyalaya in the year 2015 as the petitioner’s child has, at that time, been

admitted to Musaeus College.

Surprisingly even in the year of 2015, the Petitioner’s child was not admitted to

Vishaka Vidyalaya by the Principal of Vishaka Vidyalaya. Although, the 1st

Respondent did not admit the Petitioner’s child to Grade I in Vishaka Vidyalaya

in the year 2014, the 1st Respondent on the direction given by the Secretary to

the Ministry of Education on the same letter marked P7, has admitted a child

of one Kasturiarachchi to Grade I in Vishaka Vidyalaya in the year 2014. This

is reflected in the document marked P15a. The admission of Kasturiarachchi’s

child to Grade I in Vishaka Vidyalaya in the year 2014 on the direction made

by the Secretary to the Ministry of Education (the 2nd Respondent) was not

denied by the 1st Respondent in his affidavit filed in this Court. We note that

P7 and P15a which are the same documents had been signed by the 2nd

Respondent. Thus it appears that on the same direction given by the 2nd

Respondent the 1st Respondent decided to admit Kasturiarachchi’s child to

Grade I in Vishaka Vidyalaya in the year 2014, but she (the 1st Respondent)

did not admit the child of the Petitioner to Grade I in Vishaka Vidyalaya in the

year 2014. Thus it appears that the document marked P7 was applicable to

the child of Kasturiarachchi but not to the child of the Petitioner. On this point

itself we hold that the Petitioner’s fundamental rights guaranteed by Article

12(1) of the Constitution have been violated by the 1st Respondent. Further,

we note that although the 1st Respondent refused to admit the Petitioner’s child

on the direction given by the 2nd Respondent to Grade I in Vishaka Vidyalaya

in the year 2014, the same 1st Respondent has, on directions given by the 2nd

Respondent, admitted seven children to Grade I in Vishaka Vidyalaya in the

year 2014 on 29.05.2014 and 02.06.2014. The above mentioned admissions

are proved by documents marked P15c and P15d. P15c and P15d have been

signed by the 2nd Respondent respectively on 02.06.2014 and 29.05.2014. P7

was signed by the 2nd Respondent on 26.05.2014. We note that even the

SC.FR.NO.414/2017

4

admission numbers are found on the said documents marked P15c and P15d.

Therefore, we note that although the 1st Respondent refused to admit the

Petitioner’s child on a direction given by the 2nd Respondent (P7), the 1st

Respondent has, on subsequent directions given by the 2nd Respondent

admitted children to Grade I in Vishaka Vidyalaya in the year 2014. This is

evident by document marked P15d and P15c. We therefore hold that the 1st

Respondent has violated the fundamental rights of the petitioner guaranteed by

Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

For the above reasons, we hold that the 1st Respondent has violated the

fundamental rights of the petitioner guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the

Constitution. We therefore direct the 1st Respondent to admit the Petitioner’s

child to Grade VI in Vishaka Vidyalaya, Colombo in the year 2019. The 1st

Respondent is directed to comply with this direction within one month from the

date of this judgment.

Learned Senior State Counsel who appears for the 1st Respondent undertakes

to inform the judgment of this Court to the 1st Respondent.
