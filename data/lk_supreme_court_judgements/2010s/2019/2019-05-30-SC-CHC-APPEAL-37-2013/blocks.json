    "text": "With regard to the last sentence of section 114 (2) which calls for the documents produced in evidence to be filed as part of the record, there is a practice in many civil courts to read that requirement as permitting documents marked and produced in evidence and initialled by the trial judge in the course of a trial, to be returned to the party who has produced those documents and for the Court to call for all documents produced in evidence to be tendered to be filed in the record at the end of the trial. This is necessitated by limitations in the storage capacity of many Court Registries and other practical difficulties and has hardened into an established practice in several civil courts. In PODIRALAHAMY vs. RAN BANDA [1993 2 SLR 20 at p.21], Senanayake J commented on this practice and said \u201cThere is a duty cast on the Court once the document is admitted and endorsed with a letter to identify it that the Court should have the custody of the documents so marked and identified, though the original Courts for convenience return the documents to Attorneys of the respective parties to tender the documents if necessary after being stamped with an accurate list of the documents.\u201d. Subsequently, in PERERA vs. CALDERA [2007 1 SLR 165 at p.167], Gooneratne J, then in the Court of Appeal, recognised the existence of this practice when he stated \u201cIn the instant case the defendant-appellant's documents D1 to D10 were not only marked but also led in evidence without any objection from the opposing party. Those documents have been admitted; therefore the Court in terms of the provisions of section 114(3) should have kept them in its custody. If was for convenience the Court had allowed the Attorney-at-Law to the defendant-appellant to retain the documents during the trial, there was a duty cast on the learned District Judge to call for the documents.\u201d. It should be mentioned here that, since Gooneratne J noted that the documents had been returned to the defendant\u201fs Attorney-at-Law to be retained during the trial, His Lordships\u201fs mention of the duty cast on the trial judge to call for the documents, is a reference to calling for the marked documents to be tendered to the Court at the end of the trial. More recently, in PERERA vs. PERERA [SC Appeal No. 41/2008, decided on 03rd August 2018]. Eva Wanasundera J stated [at p.7] \u201cThus it is clear that the moment the witness speaks about the document, it should be marked and tendered by that party to Court. Thereafter it is part of the court record. Yet, in the recent past, the practice of court is that after marking the document through the witness, the marked document is then and there signed by the Judge and then given back to the Counsel/Attorney at Law who marks the document through the witness, to be submitted to Court later with the written submissions.\u201d.",

It is the duty of the aggregate of these tribunals, if I may use the expression, to take care that no act of the Court in the course of the whole of the proceedings does an injury to the suitors in the Court\". Goonewardene AJ cited several decisions which referred to the \u201c\u2026.. rule that the Court will not permit a suitor to suffer by reason of its wrongful act \u2026.. and a Court of Justice is under a duty to repair the injury done to a party by its act\u201d [vide: SIRINIVASA THERO vs. SUDASSI THERO (63 NLR 31 at p.34)] and the \u201c\u2026.. rule that a Court of Justice will not permit a suitor to suffer by reason of its own wrongful act and that it is under a duty to use its inherent powers to repair the injury done to a party by its act. [vide: SALIM vs. SANTHIYA (69 NLR 490 at p. 492)]. His Lordship went on to state [at p. 392], \u201cThe authorities undoubtedly make clear that a court whose act has caused injury to a suitor has an inherent power to make restitution. That power I am of the view is exercisable by a court of original jurisdiction as the cases show and in the case of a superior court such as the Court of Appeal there can be no doubt whatever that that power is exercisable in that way.\u201d.",

However, before delivering judgment, he was promoted to the High Court and travelled abroad on leave. The succeeding District Judge had the case called in the presence of the parties. The defendants made an application for the trial [which was a civil trial] to be heard de novo for the reason that the succeeding judge had not heard the witnesses. The plaintiff objected to that application submitting that section 48 of the Judicature Act entitled the succeeding judge to proceed to deliver judgment on the basis of the evidence that was on record. After considering written submissions filed by the parties on the aforesaid question, the succeeding judge held that, although section 48 entitled him to direct that the trial be commenced de novo, doing so will cause great prejudice to the plaintiff. He made order that the judgment will be delivered by him on the basis of the evidence that had been recorded before his predecessor. The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal, which set aside the aforesaid Order and directed that the trial be heard de novo. In appeal from that Order of the Court of Appeal [DASSENAIKE vs. DHARMARATNE [2008 2 SLR 184], the Supreme Court set aside the Order of the Court of Appeal and affirmed the Order of the District Court. Silva CJ observed [at p.185] \u201cIt is necessary for a succeeding Judge to continue proceedings since there are changes of Judges holding office in a particular Court due to transfers, promotions and the like. It is in these circumstances that Section 48 was amended giving a discretion to a Judge to continue with the proceedings. Hence the exercise of such discretion should not be disturbed unless there are serious issues with regard to the demeanour of any witness recorded by the Judge who previously heard the case. It is common ground that there are no such issues as to demeanour when evidence was adduced by the 1st defendant.\u201d.",

Thus, in AG vs. SIRIWARDANE [2009 2 SLR 337 at p. 353] Salam J observed with regard to section 48 of the Judicature Act, \u201cOn a proper analysis of the above section it would be seen the three courses available are 1. To act on the evidence already recorded and deliver judgment. 2. To act on the evidence partly recorded by the predecessor and partly recorded by the successor and deliver judgment or 3. If the successor thinks fit, to re-summon the witnesses and commence the proceedings afresh.\u201d. However, the discretion vested in the succeeding judge to follow one of the aforesaid three lines of action must be exercised reasonably since whenever the law vests a discretion in a Court, it is implicit that such discretion has to be exercised reasonably. When a succeeding judge is weighing how he should exercise the discretion vested in him by section 48 and which line of action envisaged in section 48 should be chosen by him, his decision will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case before him. These facts and circumstances will include: whether the nature of the issues before the Court make it essential for the succeeding judge to hear the witnesses and assess their demeanour and deportment in order to correctly determine the case or whether the correct decision of the case rests more on documents and it is unnecessary for the succeeding judge to rehear the oral evidence which has been led up to the point he took over the case; and whether one or both of the parties will be substantially prejudiced by hearing the trial de novo etc - vide: MV. OCEAN ENVOY vs. AL-LINSHRAH BULK CARRIERS LTD [2002 2 SLR 337]. In this regard, it is useful to cite the words of Salam J in AG vs. SIRIWARDANE [at p. 354-355] who observed, \u201cBut the application of section 48 may vary depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. Since it is a discretion vested in court, it should have been exercised diligently for it is said that a person in whom is vested a discretion must exercise his discretion upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does not empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is minded to do so - he must in the exercise of his discretion do not what he likes but what he ought. In other words, he must, by use of his reason, ascertain and follow the course which reasons direct. He must act reasonably (Roberts us. Hapwood(8) at 613).\u201d.",
