BEFORE : PRASANNA JAYAWARDENA, PC, J. MURDU FERNANDO, PC, J. S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J. COUNSEL : Pubuduni Wickramaratne for the Petitioners.

S. Rajaratnam PC, ASG for 10B, 11A, 44th, 49th, 51st-57th

Respondents.

Uditha Egalahewa PC with Ranga Dayananda for the 15th- 18th ,

21st , 25th-28th, 30th , 32nd , 34th , 36th 38th and 41st Respondents.

ARGUED ON : 11th February 2019.

WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS : Petitioners on 08th October 2018.

10B, 11A, 44th, 49th, 51st-57th Respondents on 14th

March 2019.

DECIDED ON : 7th June 2019.

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J. The Petitioners are officials attached to the Excise Department as Chief Excise

Inspectors. They have filed a Petition before this Court complaining of a violation of

their fundamental rights. It is alleged that the said department has taken steps to fill

22 posts of Superintendent of Excise on the 28th August 2008. They relied on the

Scheme of Recruitment as advertised in the Government Gazette No. 1156/31 dated

01st November 2000. According to the said Gazette, 50% of the said positions will be

filled by seniority and merit basis and the balance 50% of the 22 vacancies by Limited

Competitive Examination.

It is observed that, 11 positions were under the category of seniority and merits were

challenged before this Court and was settled subsequently.

SC/ FR 642/2012 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 16

The Excise Department took steps to fill the remaining 11 vacancies (Under the

Limited Competitive Examination category) for the post of Superintendents of Excise

by letter dated 5th July 2012 under the Reference No. EB/102/02/VI under the

signature of Excise Commissioner General and called for applications. The Chief

Excise Inspectors Union, being agitated with the said letter commenced making

representatives to various authorities including the Excise Commissioner General.

This is observed by P 13 a letter dated 17th July 2012 addressed to Excise

Commissioner General. This factor proves that, the Petitioners are in receipt of the

said letter on or about 5th July 2012 (marked as P9).

The Petitioners grievance is that, the vacancies which arose in 2008 were to be filled

in 2012 from among officers including those who are qualified as at 2012, hence, a

serious prejudice will be caused to the officers who were qualified in 2008. The

Limited Competitive examination was held as scheduled on 11th November 2012 and

according to the exam results indicate 27 candidates have passed, which includes

only 3rd , 4th , 5th and 7th Petitioners. Other Petitioners were not successful in the said

exam.

Initially this Court granted leave to proceed under Article 12(1) and stayed the

promotions.

The Respondents have submitted a proper explanation for the delay, in holding the

exam, which includes pending cases before the Supreme Court, delay in constitution

of Public Service Commission, formulating a new recruitment policy for the Excise

Department and many other reasons.

Counsels for the Respondents raised a preliminary objection from the inception that,

the Petition is time barred; hence, the Petitioners cannot maintain this application.

SC/ FR 642/2012 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 16

This matter was fully argued before this bench and all Counsel were given an

opportunity to file further written submissions. Senior Additional Solicitor General

who appeared for 10th, 44th, 49th, 51st, 52nd, 53rd, 54th, 55th, 56th and 57th Respondents

filed written submissions, emphasizing his preliminary objection.

When we perused the brief, we find that, the Scheme of Recruitment was advertised

on 1st November 2000 (marked as P3). The first recruitment to the post of

Superintendent of Excise under the Seniority and Merit Category had commenced in

August 2008.

The present process of calling for applications were commenced by the

Commissioner General of Excise by letter dated 5th July 2012 (marked as P9),

indicating the closing date as 2nd August 2012. As discussed earlier, it can be well

presumed that, all these Petitioners have received P9 on or before the 17th of July

2012.

It is submitted that, they have made an application to the Human Rights Commission

on 3rd September 2012 (marked as P 17) and the present petition is submitted

before this Court on 1st November 2012 which are after the due period stipulated in

the Constitution.

We are of the view that, petitioners have failed to challenge the P 9 within the

prescribed period stated in the Constitution.

In Alagaratnam Manorajan v. Hon G.A. Chandrasiri and others [SC 261/2013

(F/R)], SC Miunutes of 11.09.2014, her Ladyship Justice Eva Wanasundera observed

that,

SC/ FR 642/2012 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 16

I am of the opinion that, Section 13 of the Human Rights Commission Act

No.31 of 1996 should not be interpreted and/or used as a rule to suspend the

one months time limit contemplated by Article 126(2) of the Constitution,

particularly when the person alleging the violation of his fundamental rights has

not made his complaint to the HRC within one month of the alleged violation.

The provisions of an ordinary Act of Parliament should not be allowed to be

used to circumvent the provisions in the Constitution...

As held by this Court, both in the Case of Subasinghe vs. The Inspector General of

Police [ SC Special 16/99 SC Minutes of 11.09.2000] and the case of Divalage

Upalika Ranaweera and others vs. Sub Inspector Vinisias and others [SC

Application 654/2003 SC Minutes 13.05.2008],

A party seeking to utilize Section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission Act to

contend that, the period within which the inquiry into such complaint is

pending before the Commission shall not be taken into account in computing

the period of one month within which an application may be made to the

Supreme Court is obliged to place material before this Court to show that an

inquiry into his complaint is pending before the Human Rights Commission.

In Gamaethige vs. Siriwardana [1998 1SLR 384] Fernando J held that,

three principles are discernible in regard to the operation of the time limit

prescribed by Article 126(2). Time begins to run when the infringement takes

place; if knowledge on the part of the Petitioner is required (e.g. of other

instances by comparison with which the treatment meted out to him becomes

discriminatory), time begins to run only when both infringement and knowledge

exist. The pursuit of other, remedies judicial or administrative, does not prevent

or interrupt the operation of the time limit. While the time limit is mandatory, in

SC/ FR 642/2012 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 16

exceptional cases on the application of the principle lex non cogit ad

impossibilia, if there is no lapse, fault or delay on the part of the petitioner, this

Court has a discretion to entertain an application made out of time..

In Demuni Sriyani de Soyza and others v. Dharmasena Dissanayake [SC

206/2008 (F/R)] SC Minutes of 09.12.2016, his Lordship Justice Prasanna

Jayawardena observed that,

the consequence of this stipulation in Article 126(2) is that, a Petition which is

filed after the expiry of a period of one month from the time the alleged

infringement occurred, will be time barred and unmaintainable. This rule is so

well known that it hardly needs to be stated here and this Court has recognized

that it would fail to fulfil its guardianship if the time limit of one month is

applied by rote and the Court remains blind to facts and circumstances which

have denied a Petitioner of an opportunity to invoke the jurisdiction of Court

earlier.

In K.H.G. Kithsiri vs. Hon. Faizer Musthapha and Five Others (SC/FR Application

No.362/2017), SC Minutes 10.01.2018, His Lordship Aluwihare observed that,

The time limit of one month prescribed by Article 126 of the Constitution to

invoke the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction for an alleged violation is

mandatory.

Considering the series of decisions made by this Court and the submissions made by

parties with regard to Article 126(2) of the Constitution as well as sections 13 and 14

of the Human Rights Commission Act, we find that, the Petitioners have failed in

complying with the requirement of the Article 126 of the Constitution hence, we

uphold the preliminary objection raised by the Counsels for the Respondents.

SC/ FR 642/2012 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 16

For the purpose of clarity and completeness, we perused all materials before this

Court and find that, there is no violation of fundamental rights of the petitioners

guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Considering all, we hold that, there is no merit in this application. Hence, we dismiss

the application. We order no cost.

Application dismissed.
