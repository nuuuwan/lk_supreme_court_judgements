S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J

Background

The Petitioner-Appellant-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner)

originally filed an application in the Provincial High Court within the jurisdiction of

the Western Province praying for a Writ of Prohibition, prohibiting the 1st

Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 1st

Respondent) from declaring the election of the petitioner to the committee of the

Periyamulla Pradeshikaya of the 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the 2nd Respondent) as invalid.

The petitioner stated in the Petition filed in the High Court that he is a member of

the 2nd Respondent Co-operative society and that he holds a savings account in the

Rural Bank and had obtained a loan of Rs. 200,000/- on 24/08/2002 for which he had

mortgaged his property by Mortgage Bond No. 02/04 dated 24/08/2002. Later the

Petitioner had been sent a Letter of Demand to pay a sum of Rs. 178,290/-, which

had been marked and annexed to the Petition in the High Court (marked as P2).

The Petitioner had failed to honour the Letter of Demand and the matter had been

referred for arbitration. At the conclusion of the Arbitration, the Arbitrator had

ordered the Petitioner to pay the outstanding sum of Rs. 178,290/-. The Petitioner

had paid the said sum and had obtained the aforesaid Mortgage Bond released on

9/11/2006.

On 5/01/2008, the Petitioner had been elected as a member of the Periyamulla

Pradeshikaya of the 2nd Respondent.

SC Appeal 146/2016 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 11

The Petitioner states that the Head Quarters Inspector, Minuwangoda Zone of the

Co-Operative Department by letter dated 16/03/2008 had required that the

Petitioner be present for an inquiry to be held on 02/04/2008. At the inquiry, the

Petitioner had been informed that he is disqualified from contesting/ being elected

as a member of the Co-Operative Society since he had defaulted in payment of the

loan for more than three months. The Petitioner produced documents in proof of the

full settlement of the said loan and the release of the Mortgage Bond. Further, he

also informed that under the circumstance, the petitioner was not disqualified for

election. The petitioner states that the matter ended thereafter.

The Petitioner states that at the election held in October 2011, the Petitioner was

elected as a member of the Negombo Municipal Council.

On the 19th of November 2011 the Petitioner was re-elected to the Periyamulla

Pradeshikaya of the 2nd Respondent. The 1st Respondent by letter dated 23/05/2012

(marked as P5) required the Petitioner to show cause as to why a decision under

Section 60(2) of the Co-Operative Societies Statute No. 03 of 1998 of the Western

Provincial Council should not be taken to disqualify him. By letter dated 05/06/2012

sent under register cover, the Petitioner informed the 1st Respondent that he had

settled the said loan at the time of election and further informed him the relevant

facts and circumstances.

The learned Judge of the High Court held against the Petitioner and did not issue

Writ as prayed for. Being aggrieved by the decision of the learned Judge of the High

Court, the Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeal seeking to set aside the

judgment of the High Court.

After hearing both parties, the Court of Appeal held that the Rule 21(i)(e) of the Co-

Operative Societies Rules 1973 is in fact a disqualification even though the money

had been repaid and upheld the decision of the High Court. The Petitioner being

aggrieved by the decision of the Court of Appeal dated 28/03/2016 sought special

Leave to Appeal from the Supreme Court.

SC Appeal 146/2016 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 11

The Petitioner had invoked the jurisdiction of this Court with respect to the following

substantial questions of law which through a Special Leave to Appeal, [Supreme

Court Application No. SP/LA/78/2016] was granted:

a) Has the Court of Appeal erred in law in deciding the matter?

b) Has the Court of Appeal misinterpreted Rule 21(i)(e) of the Co-Operative

Societies Rules 1973 and if so, should the order made by the Court of Appeal

be set aside?

Interpretation of Rule 21(i)(e) of the Co-Operative Societies Rules 1973

In the case of Eyston v Studd (1574), 2 Plowd. 463, it was observed-

"The law may be resembled to a nut, which has a shell and a kernel

within; the letter of the law represents the shell, and the sense of it the

kernel, and as you will be no better for the nut if you make use only of

the shell, so you will receive no benefit by the law, if you rely only

upon the letter, and as the fruit and profit of the nut lies in the kernel,

and not in the shell, so the fruit and profit of the law consists in the

sense more than in the letter."

As Lady Hale reveals in R v. Secretary of State for Justice, [2017] UKSC 81, it was

observed that-

The goal of all statutory interpretation is to discover the intention of

the legislation, gathered from the words used in the statute in the

light of their context and purpose.

Hence, to interpret a statute and its subsequent regulations or rules, which are

enacted for the purpose of carrying out or giving effect to the principles and

provisions of the law, is to find the proper meaning so that it may be applied to a

particular case.

SC Appeal 146/2016 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 11

Subordinate legislation is considered to have the force of law as if they had been

enacted as an Act of Parliament as per Section 17(1)(e) of the Interpretation

Ordinance. Section 17(1) of the Interpretation Ordinance states that,

where any enactment, whether passed before or after the

commencement of this Ordinance, confers power on any authority to

make rules, the following provisions shall, unless the contrary

intention appears, have effect with reference to the making and

operation of such rules:

(e) all rules shall be published in the Gazette and shall have the force

of law as fully as if they had been enacted in the Ordinance or Act of

Parliament.

In this instance, it can be seen that the Co-Operative Societies Rules, 1973 is properly

gazetted under an Extraordinary Gazette No. 93/5 dated 10th January 1974.

The Attorney General, in this case, had provided two interpretations for Rule 21(i)(e)

of the Co-Operative Societies Rules, 1973 which are polar opposites to each other.

These two interpretations need to be thoroughly considered in order to identify the

correct interpretation of Rule 21(i)(e).

Rule 21(i)(e) of the Co-Operative Societies Rules, 1973 is reproduced as follows:

21. (i) A member of a registered society shall be disqualified from being elected,

as a member of the committee of management or of a regional or a branch

committee -

(e) If he is, in respect of any loan received by him, in default to the society or to

any other registered society or to a liquidator, for a period not exceeding three

months or is in default in any other respect to that society or to any other

society or to any liquidator;

SC Appeal 146/2016 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 11

First Interpretation provided by the Attorney General

According to the first interpretation provided by the Attorney General Rule 21(i)(e) is

not ambiguous and therefore not liable/ and should not be open for interpretation.

Lopes LJ at page 310 in R v. City of London Court Judge (1892) 1 QB 273 stated-

I have always understood that If the words of an Act are unambiguous and

clear, you must obey those words however absurd the result may appear.

In a subsequent case, R v. Wimbledon Justices, ex parte Derwent (1953) 1 QB

380, Lord Goddard CJ at page 384 observed that-

A court cannot add words to a statute or read words into it which are

not there.

In the case of Nasiruddin and Ors. v. Sita Ram Agarwal (2003) 2 SCC 577, the

Indian Supreme Court held as follows:

In a case where the statutory provision is plain and unambiguous, the court

shall not interpret the same in a different manner, only because of harsh

consequences arising there from.

It can be seen that in line of authorities, when considering the view of Sathyaa

Hettige P.C. J, in Arattana Gedera Susiripala v. Commissioner of Elections and

others SC Appeal No. 75/2010 [decided on 12th February 2014], it has been

observed that-

the function of the court is to find out and declare the intention of the

Legislature and not to add words to a statute. It is also not the

function of the Court to drop the vital part of the statutory provisions

in the section but to obey the statutory provisions. It has to be given

the true meaning intended by the legislature.

The Learned counsel for the 1st Respondent submits that the period of three months

is clearly a reference to a delay of instalments or the period within which such money

SC Appeal 146/2016 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 11

should be paid as stipulated. This is not a reference to a period of three months

preceding election. If that were the case, the words preceding would clearly be

included in the provision, as in the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.

Furthermore, the provisions clearly refer to a period exceeding three months. There

can be no provision that would have an ambiguous period of time if such time was a

reference to the preceding time to an election.

Both the Attorney General and the Court of Appeal was of the view that since the

word preceding had not been included in Rule 21(i)(e), that it was not the intention

to refer to the preceding three months and but a reference to three months after the

money was due. This has led to the view that there was no obscurity or ambiguity in

the wording of the Rule 21(i)(e) of the Rules.

The learned counsel for the 1st Respondent argued that if a potential office bearer

cannot or has not wilfully repaid the loan taken by him, he cannot be held to be

responsible with the hard-earned money of the people. Hence, this leads to the

assumption that the disqualification bar should be applied permanently since it

prevents the many occasions where a potential candidate repays a loan just prior to

elections.

Second Interpretation of the Attorney General

The Attorney General in his succeeding second interpretation with respect to the

disqualification bar of Rule 21(i)(e) stated that-the clause in question is in present

tense and read with clause 21(i) which states that he will be disqualified from being

elected, would mean that the three-month period is counted backwards from the time

of the election. As per this elucidation, it shows that the Rule in question is

ambiguous in nature.

As pointed out in Nasiruddin and Ors. (Supra)

A Courts jurisdiction to interpret a statute can be invoked when the

same is ambiguous. It is a well-known principle that in a given case

SC Appeal 146/2016 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 11

the Court can iron out the fabric but it cannot change the texture of

the fabric.

It is the duty of the Court to consider the whole document while interpreting a

provision rather than considering the single clause on its own. This is because, it is

similar to reading a book on fiction, where in order to understand the next chapter

one must read the previous chapters. Hence in interpreting Rule 21(i)(e), this court

accentuates the rule mentioned in Rule 21(i)(d) of the same set of Rules. Rule 21(i)(d)

is reproduced as follows:

21. (i) A member of a registered society shall be disqualified from being elected,

as a member of the committee of management or of a regional or a branch

committee

(d) if within the three years immediately preceding he has either been convicted

of any offence involving moral turpitude or has been sentenced to a term of

imprisonment of three months or more;

(Emphasis added)

As stated in this rule, the words three years immediately preceding shows that the

disqualification is not applied for a lifelong period but for a 3 years period prior to an

election. In Rule 21(i)(d), it mentions any offence involving moral turpitude. The

term moral turpitude has been defined in Merriam Webster as-

an act or behaviour that gravely violates the sentiment or accepted

standard of the community.

In the written submission, the learned counsel for the 1st Respondent stated at

paragraph 44 the rationale for disqualification is that the Co-Operative Societies is to

handle the money and affairs of the impoverished and therefore, complete honesty and

transparency of office bearers is essential.

SC Appeal 146/2016 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 11

Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes (12th Edition) 1969 at page 1 says that

Statute law is the will of the Legislature. Further in State of Jharkhand v Govind

Singh (2005) 10 SCC 437, the Indian Supreme Court held that

a statute is an edict of the legislature. The elementary principle of

interpreting or construing a statute is to gather the mens or sententia

legis of the legislature.

The object of all interpretation is to discover the intention of Parliament or the

drafter of any legislation or regulation, but the intention must be deduced from the

language used, for it is well-accepted that the beliefs and assumptions of those who

frame such legislations cannot make the law. Taking into consideration the intention

of the legislature, it could be seen that the purpose of the disqualification clause

(Rule 21) was to ensure that a person who is elected to a committee maintains the

highest standard of the community. Hence, such requires the show of honesty and

transparency to ensure that there is no conflict of interest.

Rule 21(i)(e) was enacted to ensure that the elected person maintains the highest

integrity and upholds the standards of the community while carrying out the duties

of the office he or she is elected to. However, when comparing this rule with Rule 21

(i)(d), it can be seen that such disqualification cannot be applied lifelong. Where a

person who commits an offence of moral turpitude is only barred for 3 years as per

Rule 21 (i)(d), a person who has defaulted for more than 3 months but has

subsequently repaid such amount should not be unfairly scrutinized, since the

reasons for defaulting could arise due to personal issues as well.

This Court is of the view that the disqualification mentioned in Rule 21(i)(e) should be

applicable for a period of three months preceding the date on which the persons

qualification for being elected is raised as an issue.

For the reasons set out earlier, I set aside those parts of the judgment of the

Provincial High Court and Court of Appeal which refer to the questions of law raised

SC Appeal 146/2016 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 11

in this case, and to which I answer affirmatively. We direct the 1st Respondent to

consider the qualification of the petitioner accordingly. We allow the appeal and

order no cost.

Appeal allowed.
