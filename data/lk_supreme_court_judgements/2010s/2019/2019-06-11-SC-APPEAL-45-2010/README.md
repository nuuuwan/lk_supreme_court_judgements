Written submission tendered on : 29.7.2010 and 22.5.2019 by the 1st Defendant-Appellant-Appellant 9.9.2010 and 24.5.2019 by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent Argued on : 10.5.2019 Decided on: 11.6.2019 Sisira J. de Abrew, J The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff-

Respondent) filed action against the Defendants in this case for a declaration

of title that he is the lawful owner of the land in question,

The learned District Judge by his judgment dated 30.8.2001, held in favour of

the Plaintiff-Respondent. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the 1st

Defendant-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 1st Defendant-

Appellant) appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court. The learned Judges of

the Civil Appellate High Court by their judgment dated 3.7.2009, affirmed the

judgment of the learned District Judge. Being aggrieved by the said judgment

of the Civil Appellate High Court, the 1st Defendant-Appellant has appealed

to this court. This court by its order dated 26.5.2010, granted leave to appeal

on the following question of law.

Did the Hon.Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of Gampaha err in law

as well as on facts in holding that the Deed bearing No.127 dated 23.8.1990

attested by N.K.de Soysa Notary Public and marked as P2 had been duly

proved in law?

The Plaintiff-Respondent at the trial took up the position that Hector Silva by

Deed No.127 (marked P2) dated 23.8.1990 attested by N.K.de Soysa Notary

SC Appeal 45/2010

4

Public had transferred the land in question to his brothers and sisters and that

brothers and sisters of Hector Silva by Deeds Nos. 3017 dated 26.3.1994,

3027 dated 18.4.1994 and 3031 dated 24.4.1994 attested by V.K.Senanayake

Notary Public transferred the land in question to Plaintiff-Respondent.

Therefore, for the Plaintiff-Respondent to get title to the land, the above

mentioned deed No.127 should be a genuine document and it must be proved

in accordance with the procedure set out in section 68 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows.

If a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not be

used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has been

called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there be an

attesting witness alive, and subject to the process of the court

and capable of giving evidence.

It has to be noted here that the Notary Public who attested Deed No.127 and

the two attesting witnesses of the sad deed were not called as witnesses.

Therefore it is undisputed that the above mentioned Deed No.127 was not

proved in accordance with the procedure set out in Section 68 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

Although the Deed No.127 marked P2 at the trial was produced by the

Plaintiff-Respondent subject to proof, the1st Defendant-Appellant at the close

of the case of the Plaintiff-Respondent, did not object to the said Deed

No.127. The learned District Judge considered the Deed No.127 marked P2 as

evidence at the trial. Learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Defendant-

Appellant contended that although the 1st Defendant-Appellant did not object

SC Appeal 45/2010

5

to the Deed No.127 marked P2 at the close of the Plaintiff-Respondents case,

it could not have been considered as evidence since it was not proved in

accordance with the procedure laid down in section 68 of the Evidence

Ordinance. The learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court however

considered the principle enunciated in Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Another

Vs Jugolinja Boal-East [1981] 1SLR 18 and decided that since the Deed

No.127 marked P2 was not objected to at the close of the Plaintiff-

Respondents case, it can be considered as evidence. In the case of Sri Lanka

Ports Authority and Another Vs Jugolinja Boal-East (supra) this court decided

as follows.

If no objection is taken, when at the close of a case documents

are read in evidence, they are evidence for all purposes of the

law. This is the curses curiae of the original civil courts."

In Balapitiya Gunananda Thero Vs Talalle Methananda Thero [1997] 2

SLR101this court held as follows.

Where a document is admitted subject to proof but when

tendered and read in evidence at the close of the case is accepted

without objection, it becomes evidence in the case. This is the

curses curiae.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent took up the same

position in his submission. Then the most important question that must be

considered in this case is when Deed No 127 which was marked subject to

proof was not objected at the close of the Plaintiff-Respondents case whether

it can be considered in evidence when it was not proved in accordance with

the procedure set out as section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance. In finding an

SC Appeal 45/2010

6

answer to this question, I would consider Robins Vs Grogan 43 NLR 269

wherein Howard CJ held as follows.

A document cannot be used in evidence, unless its genuineness

has been either admitted or established by proof, which should

be given before the document is accepted by Court.

Therefore it is seen that although a document is produced in court with or

without objection, it cannot be used as evidence if it is not proved. If the

principle enunciated in the case of Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Another Vs

Jugolinja Boal-East (supra) is accepted in respect of deeds, even a fraudulent

deed marked subject to proof can be used as evidence if it is not objected by

the opposing party at the close of the case of the party which produced it. In

such a situation, one can argue that courts will have to disregard section 68 of

the Evidence Ordinance. I do not think that the principle enunciated in the

case of Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Another Vs Jugolinja Boal-East (supra)

extends to such a situation. Whether the opposing party takes up an objection

or not to a deed which is sought to be produced, the courts will have to follow

the procedure laid down in law. In this connection I would like to consider the

judicial decision in the case of Samarakoon Vs Gunasekara [2011] 1SLR 149

wherein this court observed the following facts.

In order to prove the Plaintiffs title to the property which is

the subject matter of the action, he produced at the trial the

notarially executed deeds marked P3 to P6 which were marked

subject to proof. No witnesses were called at the trial on behalf

of the Plaintiff to prove the said deeds. At the end of the Plaintiffs

case, when the Plaintiffs Counsel read in evidence the deeds

produced in evidence marked P3 to P6, the defence had made an

SC Appeal 45/2010

7

application to Court to exclude those documents which were not

properly proved. The learned District Judge held that the

documents P3 to P6 had not been properly proved and

accordingly, that the Plaintiff had failed to prove his title to the

land in question.

The Plaintiff appealed against the decision of the District Judge

to the High Court. The High Court reversed the District Judge's

finding on the basis that when a deed had been duly signed and

executed it must be presumed that it had been properly

executed.

His Lordship Justice Amaratunga (with whom Ratnayake J and Ekanayake

agreed) held as follows.

The High Court in total disregard of the specific and stringent

provisions of Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance had relied on

an obiter dictum made in a case where due execution was

challenged, to reverse the decision of the District Judge.

In terms of Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance a

sale or transfer of land has to be in writing signed by two or

more witnesses before a notary, duly attested by the notary and

the witnesses. If this is not done the document and its contents

cannot be used in evidence.

His Lordship Justice Amaratunga at page 151 further held as follows.

A deed for the sale or transfer of land, being a document which is

required by law to be attested, has to be proved in the manner set out in

section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance by proof that the maker (the

SC Appeal 45/2010

8

vendor) of that document signed it in the presence of witnesses and the

notary. If this is not done the document and its contents cannot be used

in evidence.

Considering all the above matters, I hold that when a document which is

required to be proved in accordance with the procedure laid down in section

68 of the Evidence Ordinance is produced in evidence subject to proof but not

objected to at the close of the case of the party which produced it, such a

document cannot be used as evidence by courts if it is not proved in

accordance with the procedure laid down in section 68 of the Evidence

Ordinance. I further hold that failure on the part of a party to object to a

document during the trial does not permit court to use the document as

evidence if the document which should be proved in accordance with the

procedure laid down in section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance has not been

proved. I would like to note that the acts performed or not performed by

parties in the course of a trial do not remove the rules governing the proof of

documents.

In the present case, the Deed No.127 marked P2 has been produced in

evidence subject to proof but was not objected to at the close of the Plaintiff-

Respondents case. The said deed was not proved in accordance with the

procedure laid down in section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance. Therefore the

said the Deed No.127 marked P2 at the trial could not have been used as

evidence by the trial court. The trial court has used the said Deed No.127

marked P2 as evidence and the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High

Court have affirmed the judgment of the learned District Judge. For the above

reasons, I hold that the learned District Judge was in error when he used the

SC Appeal 45/2010

9

Deed No.127 marked P2 as evidence and the learned Judges of the Civil

Appellate High Court were also wrong when they affirmed the judgment of

the learned District Judge.

For the above reasons, I answer the above question of law in the affirmative

and set aside the judgment of the Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court

dated 3.7.2009 and the judgment of the learned District Judge dated

30.8.2001. Since I set aside the judgments of both courts below, I dismiss the

action of the Plaintiff-Respondent. The learned District Judge is directed to

enter decree in accordance with this judgment.

Judgments of the District Court and the Civil Appellate High Court set aside.
