S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

This fundamental rights application was filed by the wife of the deceased,

Rathnayake Tharanga Lakmali, on behalf of her husband Ranamukage Ajith Prasanna

who died on the 18th of September 2010 in the custody of the Police. The Petitioner

pleads that one or more or all of the Respondents and the State have infringed the

Fundamental Rights of her husband guaranteed to him under Article 11 and 13 (1)

of the Constitution.

When this matter was supported on the 25th of October 2010, this Court, upon

an application made by the Petitioner, ordered that the body of the deceased be

exhumed and be sent to the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) of the Karapitiya

Teaching Hospital to conduct a fresh Post Mortem Examination. On the 5th of May

2011, Court granted leave to proceed for alleged violation of fundamental rights

guaranteed under Articles 11 and 13 (1) of the Constitution. On the same day, the

learned Counsel for the petitioner moved to amend the caption excluding the 9th

Respondent from the case. Of consent, the 9th Respondent was discharged from the

proceedings. On the 22nd of September 2011, the Attorney General informed that he

will only be appearing for the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th and 10th Respondents and that he will

not be appearing for the 1st to the 4th Respondents. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th

Respondents were represented by their own Counsels.

According to the Petitioner, on the 16th of September 2010, when she was at

home with her husband and children, a team of police officers including the 1st

SC / FR 577/10 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 15

Respondent, Inspector of Police (IP) Niroshan Abeykoon - Officer-in-Charge of the

Crime Branch of the Embilipitiya Police Station had come to their house. They had

searched the house and nothing was found. Subsequently, they had arrested the

deceased and taken him away in a vehicle. When the Petitioner pleaded for the

reason, the 1st Respondent had told her that they were taking him to record a

statement.

On the following day, i.e. the 17th of September 2010, the Petitioner had gone

to the Police Station of Embilipitiya to visit the deceased. However, she had not been

permitted to see him. On the 18th September 2010, the Petitioner had once again

gone to the Police Station. There she was informed that the deceased had been

taken to her house. When the Petitioner returned home, she had been informed by

her mother that a police team including the 1st Respondent had brought the

deceased and shown him to them. When the child had cried, the deceased had said,

Dont come to see your father. You wont be allowed to see your father. (

, .)

The Petitioners aunt Hewavithiranage Neetha Samanthika had also been

present when the deceased was brought home at around 12 noon on the 18th

September 2010. The aunt claims that the police officers had not allowed the

deceased to speak to them. At one point, the 1st Respondent had stated Are you

making lunch? You can have your last meal today. ( ?

.) The deceased had been allowed to have his meal.

The aunt of the Petitioner had fed the deceased while he was handcuffed. At the

time, the deceased had said

Aunt I cannot eat. Food is not going below the throat. Aunt, they have

assaulted me a lot. Its very painful, they will kill me. Save me. (

. ,

. , , . )

SC / FR 577/10 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 15

The Petitioner further submits that the Police Officers who accompanied the

deceased had searched the house but had found nothing.

On the 19th of September 2010, the Petitioner had been informed by the elder

brother of the deceased that the deceased was shot and taken to the Embilipitiya

Hospital. The Petitioner together with her mother and aunt had gone to the police

station but they had been chased away by the Police Officers who had told them

Dont try to come and cry here. Go away from here. (

. .) At the Embilipitiya Hospital, she had been informed

that the 3rd Respondent had shot her husband.

The Petitioner had identified the body at the morgue in the presence of the

learned Magistrate. Initially, the Petitioner and her family had refused to accept the

body because the deceased had died while he was in police custody. An inquest was

held on the 20th of September 2010. The Post-Mortem Examination (PME) was held

on the 21st of September. The Petitioner claims that her statements were recorded

prior to the PME and that she had not been allowed to be present at the time of the

PME.

Briefly, the Petitioner claims that her husband was arrested, taken away from

her house illegally and killed by the police officers which violated his Fundamental

Rights enshrined by the Constitution under Articles 11 and 13 (1).

The Respondents have raised a preliminary objection based on non-

compliance by the Petitioner of 45 (3) of the Supreme Court Rules. The Petitioner

explains that they have tendered several due notices to the Attorney-General who

appeared initially and the delay in tendering notices on the second time arose from

the confusion that resulted from the change in counsels for the 1st to the 4th

Respondents. I find that the reason for the delay has been adequately explained. In

any event, no prejudice has been caused to the Respondents by the same. Hence, the

Preliminary Objection is overruled.

SC / FR 577/10 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 15

The Petitioner averred that

(a) the deceased has been arrested on false charges without any credible

material and without reasons being given for the arrest,

(b) the deceased has been detained in custody without adherence to

procedure established by law and without any justification,

(c) the deceased has been subject to torture, cruel, inhuman degrading

treatment and punishment by being assaulted,

(d) the deceased has been killed by the police whilst he was in the custody of

the 1st to 4th Respondents who have thereafter fabricated a version to

justify the killing.

The Respondents submit that the deceased was arrested on the 17th of

September 2010 based on credible evidence that he was involved in the unsolved

murder of Kanakanamge Ananda Sunil Shantha committed in the Embilipitiya area.

Respondents claim that live ammunitions were recovered at the house of the

deceased at the time of the arrest. Property receipts and the police information book

entry regarding the seized goods have been submitted to this Court. However, a

perusal of the entry reveals that the goods which were seized have not been properly

sealed. The Respondents submit further that facts were reported to the Magistrate of

Embilipitiya through the Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) i.e. the 7th

Respondent and a detention order was obtained (marked 6R1). Hence, they claim

that the deceased was arrested and detained properly.

Both parties relied on the inquest proceedings submitted to this Court which

has been marked as P5.

Hewavithiranage Neetha Samanthika, the Petitioners aunt gave evidence at

the inquest. She related the incident and informed the Magistrate

. (I suspect that this was a planned killing by the police). She further stated

that when he was brought home on the previous day, he was pale and his face was

SC / FR 577/10 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 15

swollen. The mother of the deceased, Balagamage Pemawathie gave evidence at the

inquest on the 28th of September 2010 and informed the learned Magistrate that the

deceased was brought handcuffed on the 18th at around 12.30 pm by a team of

police officers containing 12 personnel. She submitted that the deceased had told

her that he would be killed, . Hewayaddehiyage

Priyantha Kumara, nephew of the deceased at the inquest, stated that the deceased

was brought home on the 18th around noon and that he was handcuffed. Rathnayake

Tharanga Lakmali, wife of the deceased (i.e. the Petitioner) also gave evidence and

submitted to the magistrate that her husband was killed by the Police.

Upon the conclusion of the inquest proceedings, before the Order was made,

the Petitioner made an application before the learned Magistrate requesting that a

JMO other than the JMO in Embilipitiya be directed to conduct the Post-Mortem

Examination as she could not expect an accurate report from the latter. However, the

learned Magistrate disallowed the application. Further the learned Magistrate made

order and found that the deceaseds death was caused by the discharge of a bullet

from a firearm and referred the matter to the Attorney-General.

When this application was supported for interim relief, the Petitioner made an

application to direct the learned Magistrate of Embilipitiya to exhume the body of

the deceased and to conduct a fresh Post-Mortem Examination by a competent JMO

of Colombo or Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Galle. This Court, after hearing

submissions of both parties directed the JMO of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital,

Galle to conduct a second Post-Mortem Report and the Post-Mortem Report is

available on record.

The Respondents claim that the deceased was not subject to any torture,

cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In support of this claim, the Respondents

relied on the second PMR dated 7th July 2011 issued by the JMO of the Karapitiya

Teaching Hospital, Galle. The Respondents have not submitted the initial PMR issued

SC / FR 577/10 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 15

by the JMO of Embilipitiya. The statement of the JMO (Embilipitiya) which was

recorded in the Grave Crimes Information Book is the only document available

before us. The JMO of Embilipitiya has stated that no injuries could be seen on the

body of the deceased. However, the subsequent PMR reveals that the middle and

distal phalanxes of the left 2nd to 4th fingers were contused and hemorrhagic. The

report indicates that the injuries in the left hand are of ante-mortem nature and due

to application of blunt force, approximately 1 2 days old. Hence, it seems that the

injuries to the left hand were retained when the deceased was in the Respondents

custody. The Respondents have failed to adequately explain how the ante-mortem

injuries occurred on the deceased while he was under custody.

The Petitioner submits that the deceased was shot and killed while he was in

police custody. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents claim that it was an accidental

death and justified by law. Respondents submit that on the 18thof September 2010,

the deceased was taken out of the police station at night to recover a weapon

hidden in the deceaseds plantain grove. They claim that on the way, the deceased

had struggled with the 3rd Respondent to snatch his rifle and he was killed as a result

of a single shot that went off during the struggle. It is noted that the deceased was

taken out several times on the 17th and 18th of September. However, apart from the

entry note that was entered on the day of the arrest, the Respondents have not

submitted any notes entered in the Police information books pertaining to the

deceased being taken out of the detention cell and police station.

It is a fact that the deceased was in the custody of the Police at the time of his

death. According to the second PMR, the death of the deceased was caused by

necessarily fatal injuries to the neck and head due to the discharge of a rifled firearm

at a contact range. It is an admitted fact that the bullet was discharged from a T56

rifle in the possession of the 3rd Respondent.

The 3rd Respondent claims that the he was injured during the struggle with

the deceased. The Medico-Legal Examination Form (MLEF) submitted to Court

SC / FR 577/10 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 15

consists of a small signature initialing on three checkboxes, namely abrasion, blunt

and non-grievous, with the reason for examination being and

the conclusive remark being assault. The MLEF was issued on the 18th of September

2010 and submitted to this Court on the 6th of January 2012. No detailed Medico-

legal report has been tendered before this Court up to date. Further, there is no

patient history recorded in the said MLEF.

According to the material submitted to the Court, it is evident that the

Respondents had information to the effect that the deceased was a person from the

underworld and was involved in contract killings. It is revealed that he was so

dangerous and was kept under special custody. Moreover, on the 17th and 18th noon,

the deceased was transported under heavy guard. In light of the aforesaid

circumstances, the 1st Respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain why the

deceased was taken out at night without handcuffs with only 3 officers and the

driver, in a faulty van without a door. Section 8 (b) of the Police Department

Standing Order A20 (Rules with regard to Persons in Custody of the Police)

requires police officers to provide sufficient security where there is a possibility that

the suspect might escape or become hostile. Section 8(I) stipulates that

A person in Police custody will not be sent out for further inquiry from the

Station except for some very good reason and then only under an escort

sufficient to ensure his safe custody.

It is evident that the 1st to the 4th Respondents have acted in complete disregard of

the said standing orders.

The 1st to the 4th Respondents in their affidavits submit that the deceased had

been providing overwhelming information regarding persons involved in underworld

activities. 1st to the 4th Respondents indicated that therefore, the death of the

deceased had caused loss of a person who could have given important information

which would have led to the arrest of other culprits residing in the area. The

Respondents relied on the inquest proceedings submitted to this Court. In the said

SC / FR 577/10 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 15

proceedings, on the 20th of September at page number 12, the 1st Respondent states

as evidence,

(Many crimes were resolved as a result of the death of the suspect). The statement

has not been corrected by either party. Therefore, this also receives our attention.

As described by the Police, the deceased would have been a person involved

in grave crimes. If so, the Respondents should have been more careful in handling

him. The Respondents have not explained why they allowed a person allegedly

involved in criminal activities with the knowledge of handling of firearms, to be

without handcuffs close to a police officer with a readily loaded and unprotected

(unlocked) weapon. In these circumstances, I find the Respondents submissions to

be highly untenable.

The 5th Respondent, the Inspector of Police of the Embilipitiya Police Station,

submits that he was on special duty at the Rathnapura Saman Devalaya on the 18th

of September 2010 (i.e. the day of the deceaseds death). He submits further that he

filed a B Report under the case bearing number BR 1233/10 on the instructions of

the Headquarters Inspector (i.e. the 6th Respondent) on the 19th of September 2010.

The 6th Respondent in his affidavit affirms that a B report under his hand was filed on

the 19th of September 2010.

No submissions have been made by the 7th and 8A Respondents, i.e. the

Assistant Superintendent of Police, Ananda Samarasekara and the Inspector General

of Police, Pujitha Jayasundera. However, a detention order (marked 6R1) obtained by

the 7th Respondent is available on record. It is evident from the detention order that

although the Police had physical custody, the deceased was under the custody of the

judiciary. Hence, the 7th Respondent is responsible and answerable to Courts. In the

absence of any material regarding the steps taken by the 7th Respondent, I find that

he has failed to fulfil his responsibility.

The Respondents have relied on Justice Weeraratnes observation in

Jeganathan v. Attorney General [1982 1 Sri LR 294]

SC / FR 577/10 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 15

The petitioners allegations against the 4th and 5th respondents if proved will

carry with them serious consequences for these respondents. Furthermore, the

allegations are of a very serious nature. They must therefore be strictly proved.

This degree of cogency is seriously lacking in these proceedings which must fail

To support the proposition that allegations of torture and extra-judicial killing which

are of a very serious nature, must be strictly proved. In Jeganathan v. Attorney

General, the petitioner, a detainee at the Panagoda Army Cantonment under the

Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, had failed to refer to any

witnesses in his petition and affidavit to support the allegation that he was tortured.

Moreover, in Jeganathan, although a motion was initially filed in the Court of

Appeal to get the petitioner examined by a JMO, the said application had not been

supported even though five lawyers had had access to the petitioner on the day of

the alleged torture. However, in the instant case, to substantiate her claim, the

Petitioner has submitted affidavit evidence and the PMR issued by the JMO

Karapitiya which states that The injuries in the left hand are of ante-mortem nature

and due to application of the blunt force, approximately and 1 2 days old. Hence,

the Respondents cannot rely on Jeganathan v. Attorney General.

Our legal system provides for investigation, inquiry, trial and punishment by

proper authorities which is the base of democracy and the Rule of Law. As per

Article 13 (4) of the Constitution, no person shall be punished with death or

imprisonment except by order of a competent court. Hence, even a convicted criminal

has a right not to be arbitrarily deprived of his life except in accordance with

procedure established by law. As was observed by Justice White for the U.S. Supreme

Court in Wolff v. McDonnell [418 US 539, 555-6 (1974)]

[A] prisoner is not wholly stripped of constitutional protections when he is

imprisoned for crime. There is no iron curtain drawn between the

Constitution and the prisons... (Emphasis Added)

SC / FR 577/10 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 15

The Fundamental Rights Chapter in our Constitution does not expressly refer

to a right to life. However, the Constitution, as a living document, should not be

construed in a narrow and pedantic sense. I am of the view that constitutional

interpretation should be informed by the values embodied in it. The preamble/ svasti

of the Constitution recognises Dignity and Well-being of the People as a

fundamental value that should be furthered by assuring to all People FREEDOM,

EQUALITY, JUSTICE , FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS and the INDEPENDENCE OF

THE JUDICIARY. In my view, recognition of a right to life is in furtherance of this

fundamental value.

The conclusion that the right to life is implicitly recognised in Chapter III of the

Constitution is reinforced by International Conventions ratified by Sri Lanka. Article

27 (2) (15) of the Directive Principles of State Policy mandates the State to foster

respect for international law and treaty obligations in dealings among nations.

Interpretation of fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution in light of Sri

Lankas treaty obligations would thus be in furtherance of the aforesaid objective

spelt out in the Chapter on Directive State Policies. Thus, Chapter III, particularly

Articles 11 and 13 (4), when read in light of Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of

Human Rights, Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 11 of the International

Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of

their Families and Article 10 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with

Disabilities affirm the Right to Life.

I am in agreement with the sentiments expressed by Justice Mark Fernando

with Yapa J and J. A. N. De Silva J agreeing in Sriyani Silva v. Iddamalgoda,

Officer-in-Charge, Police Station Paiyagala and Others ([2003] 2 Sri LR 6 at

page 76 - 77). An extract of the case is reproduced below.

Although the right to life is not expressly recognised as a fundamental right,

that right is impliedly recognised in some of the provisions of Chapter III of the

SC / FR 577/10 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 15

Constitution. In particular, Article 13(4) provides that no person shall be

punished with death or imprisonment except by order of a competent court.

That is to say, a person has a right not to be put to death because of

wrongdoing on his part, except upon a court order. (There are other

exceptions as well, such as the exercise of the right of private defence.)

Expressed positively, that provision means that a person has a right to live,

unless a court orders otherwise. Thus Article 13(4), by necessary implication,

recognises that a person has a right to life at least in the sense of mere

existence, as distinct from the quality of life - which he can be deprived of only

under a court order. If, therefore, without his consent or against his will, a

person is put to death, unlawfully and otherwise than under a court order,

clearly his right under Article 13(4) has been infringed.

Article 11 guarantees freedom from torture and from cruel and inhuman

treatment or punishment. Unlawfully to deprive a person of life, without his

consent or against his will, would certainly be inhumane treatment, for life

is an essential pre-condition for being human.

I hold that Article 11 (read with Article 13(4)), recognises a right not to

deprive life whether by way of punishment or otherwise and by necessary

implication, recognises a right to life. That right must be interpreted

broadly, and the jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution on this Court for

the sole purpose of protecting fundamental rights against executive action

must be deemed to have conferred all that is reasonably necessary for this

Court to protect those rights effectively (cf. Article 118(b)).

(Emphasis added)

Considering all material available before us, I am of the view that the

Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution, particularly Articles 11 and 13

have been violated by the Respondents. I specifically find the 1st, 2nd 3rd and 4th

SC / FR 577/10 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 15

Respondents individually liable for the violation and I direct them to pay Rs.

250,000/- each individually from their personal resources to the Petitioner.

The available material does not reveal that the 5th, 6th and 7th Respondents

have fulfilled their responsibilities. Hence, I find them responsible for the violation

and order them to pay Rs. 25,000 each from their personal funds to the Petitioner.

It is the States responsibility to protect every citizen of this country. In the

instant case, I find that the State has failed its responsibility and has violated the

Fundamental Rights of the deceased. Hence, I order the State to pay Rs. 1 million as

compensation to the petitioner, i.e. wife of the deceased, Rathnayake Tharanga

Lakmali.

Application allowed.
