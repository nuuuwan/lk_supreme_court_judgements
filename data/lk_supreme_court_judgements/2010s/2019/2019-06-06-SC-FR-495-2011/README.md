The Petitioner filed this action in this court alleging that his fundamental rights

guaranteed by Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution were violated by the

Respondents. This court by its order dated 3.11.2011 granted leave to proceed for

the alleged violation of fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed by Article

12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

The Petitioner who is a seaman left for Japan in 2004 on a tourist visa and

returned to Sri Lanka in 2007. In March 2011, the Petitioner, in order to obtain his

Certificate of Watch Keeping, which is a necessary certificate to continue in his

SC FR 495/2011

profession of seaman, submitted his Continuous Discharge Certificate (hereinafter

referred to as the CDC) to the 2nd Respondent. The 2nd Respondent did not return

the said CDC to the Petitioner. The 2nd Respondent after an inquiry suspended the

said CDC for a period of six years. The Petitioner therefore contends that his

fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution

have been violated by the 2nd Respondent.

The 2nd Respondent who is the Acting Shipping Officer in his affidavit filed in this

court has submitted the following facts. Learned SSC who appeared for the

Respondents too submitted the same facts.

1. In order to consider the application of the Petitioner regarding his Certificate

of Watch Keeping, the 2nd Respondent held an inquiry.

2. At the said inquiry the Petitioner admitted that he went to Japan on a tourist

visa and overstayed in Japan for a period of three years and that the

Petitioner was deported by the Immigration officials of Japan.

3. The 2nd Respondent being satisfied of the material submitted at the inquiry

acting under Regulation 8 of the Merchant Shipping Regulations 1980 (R1),

suspended the CDC of the Petitioner for a period of six (6) years.

When I consider the above matters, the most important question that must be

considered is whether the 2nd Respondent has the power to suspend the CDC of the

Petitioner under the said Regulations. Regulation 8(a) of the Merchant Shipping

Regulations 1980(R1) published in Government Gazette No.99/6 dated 29.7.1980

reads as follows.

Notwithstanding anything contained in these regulations, the Shipping

Officer may suspend, cancel or confiscate the Continuous Discharge

Certificate of any seaman who is shown to the satisfaction of the Shipping

SC FR 495/2011

4

Officer to have deserted his ship or is found guilty of smuggling, theft,

misbehavior or such other offence, as may, in the opinion of the Shipping

Officer, makes him unsuitable for employment on board a ship.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner tried to contend that the decision of

the 2nd Respondent to suspend the CDC of the Petitioner was a malicious decision

since the Petitioner has a family dispute with the 1st Respondent. I am unable to

agree with this contention since it is the 2nd Respondent who has taken the said

decision. The following facts are undisputed.

1. The Petitioner illegally overstayed in Japan for a period of three years.

2. The Petitioner was, due to his illegal overstay in Japan, deported.

Learned Senior State Counsel (SSC) who appeared for the Respondents contended

that such a person has a tendency to desert his ship during his employment in the

ship. I think there is merit in this argument. Learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner contended that for the 2nd Respondent to act under the Regulation 8(a) of

the Merchant Shipping Regulations 1980, there must be a conviction of the

Petitioner by a court of law under the said section. But the Regulation 8(a) of the

said Regulations does not speak about a conviction by a court of law. Therefore, I

am unable to agree with the said contention of learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner. When I consider Regulation 8(a) of the Merchant Shipping Regulations

1980 (R1), I hold the view that under the said Regulation, if a seaman, in the

opinion of the Shipping Officer, is guilty of an offence which renders him (the

seaman) unsuitable for employment in a ship, the Shipping Officer can suspend or

cancel the CDC of the seaman. It has to be noted here that the 2nd Respondent (the

Shipping Officer) has taken the decision to suspend the CDC of the Petitioner after

SC FR 495/2011

5

an inquiry conducted him. The Petitioner who illegally overstayed in Japan for a

period of three years was deported by the Immigration Officials of Japan. When

the Petitioner enjoys such a reputation, can the Shipping Officer decide that the

Petitioner is suitable for employment in a ship? In my view such a person is not

suitable to be employed in a ship. For the above reasons, I hold that the Shipping

Officer, the 2nd Respondent was correct when he, acting in terms of Regulation

8(a) of the Merchant and Shipping Regulations 1980, decided to suspend the CDC

of the Petitioner for a period of six years. In my view, the Petitioner has failed to

prove that his fundamental rights had been violated as alleged by him. For the

above reasons, I dismiss the petition of the Petitioner with costs.
