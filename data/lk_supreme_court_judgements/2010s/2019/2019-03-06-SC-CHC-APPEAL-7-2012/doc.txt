Defendant-Appellants Vs Dynamic Steel (Private) Ltd., 484, Annanagar West Exten, Chennai, 600-101, India. Plaintiff-Respondent Before : Sisira J de Abrew J V.K.Malalgoda PC J Murdu Fernando PC J Counsel : Maithri Wickramasinghe PC with Rakitha Jayathunga for the Defendant-Appellants Canishka Witharana for the Plaintiff-Respondent Argued on : 9.1.2019 Written Submission Tendered on : 10.2.2012 by the Defendant-Appellants 21.3.2016 by the Plaintiff-Respondent Decided on : 6.3.2019 Sisira J de Abrew J

The Plaintiff-Respondent in this case instituted action against the Defendant-

Appellants to recover a sum of US Dollars 160,139.64

The learned High Court Judge of the Commercial High Court, by his judgment

dated 24.11.2011, held in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent and concluded that a

sum of Rs.4,195,353.33 is payable by the 1st Defendant-Appellant to the Plaintiff-

Respondent. Being aggrieved by the said judgment the Defendant-Appellants have

appealed to this court.

3

The 1st Defendant-Appellant has, from time to time, purchased certain materials

and machinery used in the steel industry from the Plaintiff-Respondent. According

to the admissions recorded at the trial, the Defendant-Appellants have paid US

Dollars (USD) 1750 on two occasions in connection with invoice No.131 and 138

in settlement of the sum due on purchase of goods from the Plaintiff-Respondent.

However the Plaintiff-Respondent in its plaint takes up the position that the

Defendant-Appellants have paid USD 4511.33 and USD 1750 on 27.6.2003 and

21.3.2001 respectively in order to settle the balance due from the Defendant-

Appellants. Learned President’s Counsel for the Defendant-Appellants submitted

that the claim of the Plaintiff-Respondent had been prescribed within one year

from the date of sale of goods in terms of Section 8 of the Prescription Ordinance.

He contended that the Plaintiff-Respondent had sold goods to the 1st Defendant-

Appellant and that therefore the claim of the Plaintiff-Respondent would be

prescribed within one year from the date of sale of goods in terms of Section 8 of

the Prescription Ordinance. He relied on the concept of ‘goods sold and delivered.’

Learned President’s Counsel for the Defendant-Appellants further submitted that

the Plaintiff-Respondent had instituted this action on individual invoices and that

therefore the action of the Plaintiff-Respondent would be prescribed within one

year from the date of the transaction in terms of Section 8 of the Prescription

Ordinance. But the position of the Plaintiff-Respondent was that the action had

been instituted on the basis of accounts stated and not on the basis of individual

invoices. The learned High Court Judge has however considered Section 7 of the

Prescription Ordinance and decided to accept the position taken up by the Plaintiff-

Respondent. The learned High Court Judge further held that the action of the

Plaintiff-Respondent was not prescribed. In these circumstances, I would like to

4

consider Sections 7 and 8 of the Prescription Ordinance. Section 7 of the

Prescription Ordinance reads as follows.

“No action shall be maintainable for the recovery of any movable property,

rent, or mesne profit, or for any money lent without written security, or for

any money paid or expended by the plaintiff on account of the defendant, or

for money received by defendant for the use of the plaintiff, or for money due

upon an account stated, or upon any unwritten promise, contract, bargain,

or agreement, unless such action shall be-commenced within three years

from the time after the cause of action shall have arisen.”

Section 8 of the Prescription Ordinance reads as follows.

“No action shall be maintainable for or in respect of any goods sold and

delivered, or for any shop bill or book debt, or for work and labour done, or

for the wages of artisans, labourers, or servants, unless the same shall be

brought within one year after the debt shall have become due.”

The most important question that must be decided in this case whether action of

the Plaintiff-Respondent is prescribed or not. If the action of the Plaintiff-

Respondent has been instituted on the basis of ‘account stated’, then the action is

not prescribed. I now advert to this question. In order to consider this question

paragraphs 15 and 16 of the Plaint should be examined. Paragraph 15 of the Plaint

reads as follows.

“The Plaintiff states that in the Annual Accounts prepared by the Plaintiff

for the Fiscal Year ended from 31st March 2000 a balance of a sum of US

Dollars 54,608.65 was found to be entered in the corresponding value in

Indian Rupees as the amount due to the Plaintiff from the 1st Defendant

Company. (A true copy of the Annual Accounts stated for the Fiscal Year

5

1999-2000 is annexed hereto marked as P7 and pleaded as part and parcel

of the Plaint).

Paragraph 16 of the Plaint reads as follows.

“The Plaintiff also found the said value of US Dollars 54,608.65 equivalent

in Sri Lankan Rupees is entered under the heading „Current Liabilities‟ as

Rupees 6,968,375 in the Balance Sheet that forming part of the Annual

Accounts of the 1st Defendant for the year ended from 31st March 2000. (A

true copy of the Annual Accounts of the Defendant Company for the year

ended from 31st March 2000 is annexed to the Plaint marked P8 and pleaded

as part and parcel of the Plaint.”

Further at the trial, Kodikar Madar Sahib Ajmal Ahamed, Charted Accountant who

is the Statutory Auditor of the 1st Defendant-Appellant giving evidence produced

the Financial Accounts of the 1st Defendant-Appellant marked P23 for the year

ended on 31.3.2003. According to the said report under the heading of ‘Current

Liabilities and Creditors’ an amount of Rs.4,195,353/33 has been entered and

under the heading of ‘Creditors’, ‘Dynamic Steel (Pvt) Ltd, 404, Annanager,

Madras 600101,India’has been typed and against the said name Rs.4,195,353/33

has been typed. ‘Dynamic Steel (Pvt) Ltd, 404, Annanager, Madras 600101, India’

is the Plaintiff-Respondent in this case. The above particulars clearly indicate that

the action of the Plaintiff-Respondent has been instituted on the basis of Account

Stated and not on the basis of individual invoices. Further in the statement of

Financial Accounts of the 1stDefendant Company (the 1st Defendant-Appellant) for

the year ended 31.3.2003 marked P23, the 1st Defendant-Appellant has admitted

that his creditor was the Plaintiff-Respondent and that the current liability to the

creditor was Rs.4,195,353.33. This is an admission by the 1st Defendant-Appellant

that the amount payable to the Plaintiff-Respondent as at 31.3.2003 was

6

Rs.4,195,353.33. The case was filed in the Commercial High Court on 27.2.2004.

Thus the action of the Plaintiff-Respondent has not been prescribed in terms of

Section 7 of the Prescription Ordinance. Even in the statement of Financial

Accounts of the 1stDefendant Company (the 1st Defendant-Appellant) for the year

ended 31.3.2000 marked P20, the 1st Defendant-Appellant has admitted that one of

his creditors was the Plaintiff-Respondent and that the current liability to the

creditor was Rs.6,017,410.62. Similar entries are found in the statement of

Financial Accounts of the 1stDefendant Company (the 1st Defendant-Appellant) for

the year ended on 31.3.2001(P21) and 31.3.2002(P22). Thus it appears that in his

own statements of Financial Accounts, the 1st Defendant-Appellant has admitted

his liability to the Plaintiff-Respondent. When I consider the above matters, I am

of the opinion that the applicable provision relating to prescription is section 7 of

the Prescription Ordinance and not section 8 of the Prescription Ordinance. This

view is supported by the judgment of Justice Garvin in the case of Silva Vs Silva

36 NLR 307 wherein His Lordship observed the following facts.

“There was an account in respect of goods sold and delivered between plaintiff and

defendant, consisting of debit entries in respect of goods sold to the defendant and credit

entries in respect of payments by him. On a certain date the accounts were looked into

and a balance found to be due, which the defendant acknowledged by signing a

document.

His Lordship held as follows: “An action to recover the balance was prescribed in

three years.”

For the above reasons, the contention of learned President’s Counsel for the

Defendant-Appellants that the action of the Plaintiff-Respondent has been

prescribed in terms of Section 8 of the Prescription Ordinance cannot be accepted

and is hereby rejected.

Considering all the above matters, I hold that the action of the Plaintiff-Respondent

7

has not been prescribed and that the learned High Court Judge was correct when he

held in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent.

For the above reasons, I dismiss the appeal of the Defendant-Appellants with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
