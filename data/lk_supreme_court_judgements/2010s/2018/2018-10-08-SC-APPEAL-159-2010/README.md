Priyasath Dep PC, CJ

The Plaintiff Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff-

Respondent) instituted action on 05.11.1999 in the District Court of Kurunegala against the

Defendant Petitioner Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant-Appellant)

seeking damages in a sum of Rs. 2.5 million for instigating the police to institute criminal

proceedings against him in the Magistrates Court (malicious prosecution) without any

reasonable or probable cause whatsoever.

The Police instituted criminal proceedings in the Magistrate Court of Kurunegala in Case

No. 26018/87 pursuant to a complaint made by Herath Mudiyanselage Wimalasiri, the

Secretary of the Dayaka Sabha of the Defendant-Appellants hermitage in Dolukanda at the

instance of the Defendant-Appellant. The Complaint was to the effect that the Plaintiff-

Respondent, his wife and five others introduced items of ladies garments to a chamber in

Defendant-Appellants hermitage with the objective of bringing the Appellant to disrepute.

The Plaintiff-Respondent was charged with offences punishable under Sections 440 of the

Penal Code for lurking house trespass or housebreaking in order to commit an offence and

under section 291B of the Penal Code for deliberately and maliciously outraging the

religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. The Respondent

was thereafter arrested and later released on bail on 08.11.1997.

When the case was first taken up for trial in the Magistrates Court, the Defendant-

Appellant who was the 1st witness in the case was not present in Court and has tendered a

medical certificate. The trial was thereafter postponed to 15.02.1998 and the Defendant-

Appellant failed to appear even on that day and has not furnished any plausible reason for his

absence. The case was postponed to 15.02.1999 and when the case was taken up on that day

another medical certificate was produced on behalf of the Defendant- Appellant. The learned

Magistrate refused to accept the same and proceeded to acquit the Plaintiff-Respondent

SC Appeal No: 159/2010

3

observing that the Appellant is intentionally evading Court and that the other prosecution

witnesses were not interested in the case.

The Plaintiff-Respondent after the acquittal instituted action against the Defendant-

Appellant in the District Court of Kurunegala in Case No.6228/M claiming damages in a sum

of rupees 2.5 million for malicious prosecution. The Defendant-Appellant in his answer

stated that the said Magistrate Court case was instituted by the police and not on a complaint

made by him and that he was only a witness for the prosecution. The Defendant- Appellant

set up a claim in reconvention claiming damages in a sum of Rs. 2.5 million for the vexatious

conduct of the Plaintiff- Respondent in filing this action which resulted in tarnishing his

reputation and the good name.

The trial in the District Court was fixed for 22.09.2000 and on that date the Defendant-

Appellant failed to appear and the learned judge allowed the application for postponement

subject to cost and the case was re fixed for 15.12.2000. The Defendant-Appellant failed to

appear on that day also and his Attorney at Law informed the Court that he had no

instructions to appear. Thereafter the learned judge proceeded to hear the case ex-parte

allowing the Plaintiff-Respondent to lead evidence. Thereupon having evaluated the evidence

led, the learned judge entered an ex-parte judgment in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent as

prayed for in the plaint .The decree was duly served on the Appellant on 27.06.2001.

The Defendant- Appellant filed an application on 03.07.2001 under Section 86(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code seeking to set aside the ex-parte judgment stating that the judgment had been

entered without a proper adjudication. It should be noted that the Defendant-Appellant did

not seek to purge his default through the said application by furnishing a plausible

explanation for the default but merely canvassed the merits of the said ex-parte judgment.

The inquiry into the said application was disposed of by way of written submissions and the

learned District Judge made order dated 30.05.2002 dismissing the Defendant-Appellants

application as the Defendant -Appellant failed to purged his default. The Defendant-

Appellant filed a Petition of Appeal bearing No. NWP/HCCA/51/2002 in the High Court

(Civil Appellate) of the North Western Province against this order seeking to set aside the

same. However this action was abandoned by the Defendant-Appellant having caused

substantial expenses to the Plaintiff-Respondent.

After a lapse of eight years, Defendant- Appellant filed a revision application bearing No.

NWP/HCCA/ KUR/05/2009 (Revision) before the same court stating that he has received

SC Appeal No: 159/2010

4

fresh legal advice that he would not be able to canvass propriety/validity of the ex-parte

judgment in the earlier appeal. The High Court delivered its judgment on 25.02.2010

dismissing the appeal and holding that inordinate delay in filing the application, absence of a

reasonable excuse and his culpable conduct in the proceedings disentitles him for a relief in

revision. The Court also noted that even though the District Judge has not specifically

evaluated the evidence, the evidence adduced by the Respondent in the ex-parte trial is

sufficient to prove his case.

Questions of Law

The Defendant-Appellant being aggrieved by the said order sought Leave to Appeal from this

Court against the said order of the High Court and obtained leave on following questions of

law;

a) Has the High Court erred in law in its reasoning that the evidence adduced at the ex-

parte trial was sufficient to establish the Respondents case?

b) Did the Civil Appellate High court err in law by its failure to consider that what was

in issue was not sufficiency of evidence alone but whether the Respondent has made

out the constituent elements in an action for malicious prosecution?

The first question of law

It is pertinent to refer to the submissions made by both parties regarding the sufficiency of

evidence adduced at the ex-parte trial to establish the case of the Plaintiff Respondent.

The Defendant- Appellant submitted that the learned District Judge proceeded to grant reliefs

prayed for in the Plaintiff-Respondents plaint on the basis that the evidence of the Plaintiff-

Respondent has not been controverted. There should be proper evaluation of facts and the

law even in an ex-parte trial.

Unlike in an inter parte trial, the trial judge will not have the benefit of the cross examination

which will test the credibility of the witnesses and the admissibility of the documents. This is

due to conduct of the defaulting party. In any civil case whether trial is an ex- parte or inte-

parte judgement should be in accordance with section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Section 187 reads thus:

The judgement shall contain a concise statement of the case, the points for

determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for such decision; and the opinions of

SC Appeal No: 159/2010

5

the assessors(if any) shall be prefixed to the judgement and signed by such assessors

respectively.

In the case of Sirimavo Bandaranaike Vs Times of Ceylon Ltd (1995)1 Sri L.R pp 22-44

Justice Mark Fernando held that:

Even an Ex parte trial , the judge must act according to law and ensure that the

relief claimed is due in fact and in law, and must dismiss the plaintiffs claim

if he is not entitled to it. An Ex parte judgement cannot be entered without a

hearing and an adjudication.

Section 85(1) requires that the trial judge should be satisfied that the

Plaintiff is entitled to the relief claimed. He must reach findings on the relevant

points after a process of hearing and adjudication. This is necessary where less

than the relief claimed can be awarded if the judges opinion is that the entirety

of the relief claimed cannot be granted. Further, sections 84,86 and 87 all

refer to the judge being satisfied on a variety of matters in every instance ;

such satisfaction is after adjudication upon evidence.

There are two distinct issues. The first is whether the ex parte default judgment

was procedurally proper and this depends on whether a condition precedent

had been satisfied, namely whether a proper order for ex parte trial had been

made and whether the defendant had failed to purge his default. The second is

whether , apart from the default, the ex parte default judgment was, on the

merits i.e.in respect of its substance, vitiated by lack of jurisdiction, error and

the like.

.

Submissions of the Parties

Defendant-Appellant submitted that it is manifest from the ex-parte judgment that the learned

trial judge has failed to observe the requirements under Section 85(1) an 85(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code. Defendant- Appellant submitted that the learned judges of the High Court,

even after observing such deficiency in evidence has held that such deficiency has not

resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Defendant-Appellant has further submitted that although

SC Appeal No: 159/2010

6

the learned judges of the High Court had come to a conclusion that the evidence led on behalf

of the Plaintiff-Respondent was sufficient to establish his claim, Plaintiff-Respondent has not

proved the elements required for an action in malicious prosecution.

The Plaintiff- Respondent on the other hand had submitted that there is no basis for

interfering with the judgment of the District Judge as the ingredients for malicious

prosecution and the basis for the award of damages are sufficiently evidenced by the material

on record notwithstanding that the learned District Judge has not gone into details in

analyzing evidence.

In support of his position the Plaintiff- Respondent has cited several cases including two

Court of Appeal Judgments. In the case of Rev. Minuwangoda Dhammika Thero vs Rev

Galle Saradha Thero 2003(3) SLR 247 it was held that Though there is no evaluation of the

evidence led, on an examination of the evidence led at the ex-parte trial, it appears that the

trial judge was correct.

In Victor and Another Vs Cyril De Silva 1998 (1) SLR. where court held that where there was

sufficient material on record the appellate court will not interfere.

These judgments have considered whether mere absence of reasons or failure to evaluate

evidence in ex-parte judgement would vitiate the judgment or not, where there was sufficient

material on record

These judgments have also considered the requirements set out in Section 187 of the Civil

Procedure Code (requisites of a judgment) together with Article 138 (1) of the Constitution

including the proviso which reads as follows; Provided that no judgment, decree or order of

any court shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity which

has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice

The Plaintiff-Respondent has also emphasized the fact that the learned High Court judges

have affirmatively held that there is sufficient evidence on record. It was submitted that

failure to evaluate evidence or give reasons should not affect the validity of the judgment if

there is sufficient evidence to satisfy the Judge.

SC Appeal No: 159/2010

Second Question of Law

The Second question of law in this appeal is whether the Plaintiff-Respondent has proved the

constituent elements in an action for malicious prosecution or not.

The action of the Plaintiff -Respondent is an action for recovery of damages for malicious

prosecution which is governed by the principles of Roman Dutch law. It is the submission of

the Defendant-Appellant that the Plaintiff-Respondent had failed to prove necessary elements

required in an action for malicious prosecution.

R.G.Mckerron (Law of Delict -6th Platinum Re-Print 2009 at page at 259) stated :

Every person has a right to set the law in motion, but a person who institutes

legal proceedings against another maliciously and without reasonable and

probable cause abuses that right and commits an actionable wrong. Although

the rule is directly traceable to the influence of English Law it has its origin in

principles which are common to our law and the law of England

(Our law referred to the judgment is South African Civil law which is based on Roman

Dutch Law).

In the case of Karunaratne Vs Karunaratne 63 NLR 365, in which Basnayake J has observed

as follows;

To succeed in an action of this nature, the Plaintiff must establish that the

charge was false and false to the knowledge of the person giving the

information that it was made with a view to prosecution, that it was made

animo injuriandi and not with a view to vindicate pubic justice and that it was

made without probable cause

The substantive requirements of the action for malicious prosecution can be described as

follows;

a) The institution of proceedings

b) The absence of reasonable and probable cause

c) Malice

d) The termination of proceedings in Plaintiffs favour.

e) Damages.

SC Appeal No: 159/2010

I. Institution of proceedings

The Defendant-Appellants contention is that the said proceedings in the Magistrates

Courts were instituted by the police based on investigations conducted by the police

and that the Defendant- Appellant merely made a statement in the course of the

investigations. The Defendant- Appellant submitted that the report filed by the police

in the Magistrates Court in Case No. 26018/91 discloses that the complaint has been

made by one Herath MudiyanselageWimalasiri and based on that complaint the

Officer- in Charge conducted investigations and that the investigations revealed

that ladies garments have been introduced to one of the rooms in the Defendant-

Appellants hermitage. According to the Defendant-Appellant this investigation

provided sufficient material to charge the suspects in the Magistrates Court.

Defendant- Appellant has further submitted that other than getting the said Wimalasiri

to report the incident to the Police, he has not instigated and/or set in motion the

prosecution and that the police was justified in instituting the action on the material

which was revealed in the course of the investigations.

The Defendant- Appellant has cited the case of Saravanamuttu Vs Kanagasabai 43

NLR 357 where Howard CJ expressed the view that:

In an action for malicious prosecution in order to establish that the defendant set

the criminal law in motion against the plaintiff that there must be something more

than a mere giving of information to the police or other authority who institutes

the prosecution. There must be the formulation of a charge or something in the

way of solicitation, request or incitement of proceedings.

The Privy Council judgment in Tewari Vs Bhagat Singh 24 TLR 884 which has been

quoted with approval in Hendriack Appuhamy Vs Matto Singho 44 NL459 is relevant

to the facts of the present case. It states thus:

If a complainant did not go beyond giving what he believed to be correct

information to the Police and the Police, without further interference on his part

(except giving such honest assistance as they might require) thought fit to

prosecute, it would be improper to make him responsible in damages for the

failure of the prosecution. But if the charge was false to the knowledge of the

SC Appeal No: 159/2010

9

complainant, if he misled the Police by bringing suborned witnesses to support it,

if he influenced the Police to assist him in sending an innocent man for trial

before the Magistrate, it would be equally improper to allow him to escape

liability because the prosecution had not technically been conducted by him. The

question in all cases of this kind must be Who was the prosecutor ? And the

answer must depend upon the whole circumstances of the case. The mere setting

of the law in motion was not the criterion, the conduct of the complainant, before

and after making the charge, must also be taken into consideration.

The Plaintiff- Respondent maintains the position that it was Defendant- Appellant who

instigated the police to institute proceedings in the Magistrates Court. Plaintiff-Respondent

states that there are contradictions between the statements made by the Appellant and

Wimalasiri who gave the first information to the police, He further submitted that it was at

the instance of the Appellant, Wimalasiri made the first complaint to the police. Further the

Plaintiff-Respondent has submitted that the complaint was a false complaint made to tarnish

his reputation and image.

Plaintiff-Respondent submitted that he was falsely implicated in the case because of

campaign he led to protect the Dolukanda forest reserve from the illegal constructions of the

Appellant and consequently the ill will that the Appellant bore towards the Respondent. It is

abundantly clear that the Defendant -Appellant instigated the police to institute proceedings.

Having instituted proceedings the Defendant -Appellant kept away from Courts and his

conduct is reprehensible.

II. Failure of Prosecution

In the Magistrates Court proceedings, the Plaintiff-Respondent was discharged under

section 188(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act as the Defendant-Appellant

and other witnesses repeatedly failed to appear on the given dates. However the

Appellant attributes the failure of the prosecution to the Police and not to him and

maintains the view that he was merely a witness in the said proceedings. Therefore it

is the contention of the Defendant-Appellant that the failure of the prosecution in the

said case was attributable to the lethargic conduct of the Police for not securing the

presence of the complainant Wimalasiri and witness Karunaratna.

SC Appeal No: 159/2010

10

It is the failure on the part of the Defendant- Appellant and his witnesses to attend

Courts that led to the discharge of the Plaintiff-Respondent. (the Magistrate in his

order referred to it as an acquittal). Police did not reopened the case within one year

and under section 188(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act an order of discharge

operates as an acquittal. The proceedings have terminated in favour of the Plaintiff-

Respondents.

III. Malice and the absence of reasonable and probable cause.

The Defendant-Appellant has submitted that the Police after conducting investigations

had a probable and reasonable cause to institute action. In relation to the element of

malice, Defendant -Appellants position is that when he made the statement to the

police on 07.11.1997, the police had already commenced their investigations. He

came to know of the involvement of the Plaintiff-Respondent in the course of the

investigations.

The Plaintiff-Respondent submitted that his evidence and the documents marked and

produced as P1, P2, P3, P4, P11, P13, P14, P15, P16, P17, P18, P19,P20 shows the motive

to falsely implicate him due to the fact that he has played an active role in protesting and

canvassing public authorities and officers against the Appellants illegal destruction of

valuable forest reserve as well as causing environmental degradation.

R.G. Mckeron, Law of Delict (supra) at pages 263-264 states that

The Plaintiff must prove that the defendant actuated by malice. By malice it is

to be understood not necessarily personal spite and ill will, but any improper or

indirect motive some motive other than a desire to bring to public a person who

one honestly believes to be guilty He goes on to explain that the existence of

malice can be established either by showing what the motive was and that it was

wrong or by showing that the circumstances were such that the prosecution can

only be accounted for by imputing some wrong or indirect motive to the

prosecutor. Malice may be inferred from want of reasonable and probable

cause, but it is not a necessary inference..

The Plaintiff- Respondent by giving evidence and producing documents proved that he

campaigned against the activities of the Defendant -Appellant that resulted in ill will and

personal animosity towards the Plaintiff- Respondent.

SC Appeal No: 159/2010

11

With regard to reasonable and probable cause, Respondent has cited the definition provided

by Hawkins J in Hicks Vs Faulkner (1878) 8 QBD 167 pg 171 to be an honest belief in the

guilt of the accused based upon a full conviction, founded upon reasonable grounds of the

existence of a state of circumstances which assuming them to be true, would reasonably lead

an ordinary prudent and cautious man placed in the position of the accuser, to the conclusion

that the person charged was probably guilty of the crime imputed.

Plaintiff-Respondent submits that these ingredients are lacking in Defendant. Appellant who

had acted with malice without reasonable and probable cause.

Damages

The next question is whether the Plaintiff is entitled to the damages claimed for or to the part

of the claim. Malicious prosecutions belong to class of actions falling under Actio Injuriarum.

In such an action the Plaintiff can claim damages for pain of mind, injury to feelings and

reputation and also for patrimonial loss. Plaintiff- Respondent has testified that he was getting

a monthly profit of Rs. 150,000/- to 200,000/- and since the criminal case was instituted he

was prevented from properly conducting his business causing him a loss of Rs. 2.5 million to

Rs.3 million. However Defendant-Appellant submitted that no documentary proof of

accounts of the business have been produced apart from the evidence of the Plaintiff-

Respondent who had given evidence of his business, its earnings and the losses .

Plaintiff-Respondent on the other hand has submitted that considering the unchallenged

evidence produced in court, the judgment for a sum of Rs. 2.5 million cannot be alleged as

arbitrary or excessive. Citing Gatley-Libel and Slander ( 11th Edition) pp 265-270 stated that

Malicious prosecution involves hurt to reputation and feelings and this is not something that

can be technically or arithmetically calculated/quantifiable but is based on policy

considerations depending on the status, position of the person affected and the nature of the

prosecution. Compensation unlike in other cases is not merely to repair damages but punitive

and deterrent.

Plaintiff-Respondent is a long standing resident of the area, a businessman involved in social

work and politics , Member of the Pradeshiya Sabha .Due to the institution of the Criminal

proceedings he was arrested and remanded and was subjected to much humiliation and pain

of mind. The proceedings before the Magistrates Court has taken more than 15 months.

SC Appeal No: 159/2010

12

Conclusions

In order to succeed in his action, the Plaintiff- Respondent is required to prove that in fact

and in law he is entitled to the relief claimed for. The Plaintiff -Respondent gave evidence

and produced documents marked P1-P20 and satisfied the Court that he is entitled to

judgment in his favour. His evidence alone and document he produced are sufficient to prove

his case. It was alleged that the District Judge failed to evaluate the evidence and thereby

failed to comply with section 183 of the Civil Procedure Code.

The learned Judges of the High Court observed that even though the District Judge has not

specifically evaluated the evidence, the evidence adduced by the Respondent in the ex-parte

trial is sufficient to prove his case. The High Court in its judgment dismissing the appeal

held that the inordinate delay in filing the revision application, absence of a reasonable

excuse and the Plaintiff -Respondents culpable conduct in the proceedings disentitles him for

a relief in revision.

I hold that failure to give reasons or to evaluate evidence in ex parte trial will not affect the

validity of the judgment if there is sufficient evidence on record to satisfy the judge that the

Plaintiff -Respondent is entitled to the relief claimed for. Proviso to Article138(1) of the

Constitution could be applied to section 183 of the Civil Procedure Code. Therefore the

Appellate Court should not interfere with the Judgment if the evidence placed before the

Court is sufficient to satisfy the Judge and the judgment is correct and has not prejudiced the

substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice

I hold that the High Court (Civil Appeals) did not err in law in its reasoning that the evidence

adduced at the ex-parte trial was sufficient to establish the Respondents case.

The next question is whether the Plaintiff -Respondent established the necessary elements of

malicious prosecution. In the Magistrates Court, Police instituted criminal proceeding under

section 136(1) B of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. The virtual Complaint is

Wimalasiri, the secretary of the Dolukanda Hermitage. He was instigated by the Defendant -

Appellant to make the complaint and thereby the Defendant -Appellant became the accuser

in this case. The proceeding instituted in this case ended in an acquittal and the proceedings

terminated in favour of the Plaintiff- Respondent. The Plaintiff -Respondent established that

the Defendant -Appellant acted maliciously and without reasonable and a probable cause.

SC Appeal No: 159/2010

13

Plaintiff -Respondent had proved the necessary elements of malicious prosecution. The

damages awarded is not excessive.

High Court (Civil Appellate) did not err in law when it held that the Plaintiff -Respondent

has made out the constituent elements in an action for malicious prosecution.

The next question is whether Plaintiff -Respondent is entitled to the damages claimed for and

if so the amount (quantum) of damages to be awarded.

Due to the institution of criminal proceeding, the plaintiff suffered damages. His reputation as

a politician, social worker and businessman was tarnished. He was humiliated and insulted .

His business was affected. The Plaintiffs evidence and the documents produced is sufficient

to prove damages. The conduct of the Defendant - Appellant is deplorable and damages

should be punitive and deterrent. I am of the view that the damages awarded is reasonable

and not arbitrary or excessive.

I affirm the judgment of the District Court and the Judgment of the High Court of Civil

Appellate.

The Appeal dismissed. The Defendant-Appellant is ordered to pay Rs. 100,000/= (one

hundred thousand) to the Plaintiff-Respondent as Costs. Further the Plaintiff-Respondent is

entitled to cost in the District Court and in the High Court (Civil Appellate).
