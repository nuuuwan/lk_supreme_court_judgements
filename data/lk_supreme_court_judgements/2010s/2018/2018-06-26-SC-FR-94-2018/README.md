COUNSEL: Harsha Fernando with Chamith Senanayake, Ruvendra Weerasinghe instructed by Jagath Thalgaswatte for the Petitioners. Viraj Dayaratne, Addl. SG with Mahen Gopallawa, DSG for all the Respondents except the 6th Respondent. Romesh de Silva, PC with Shanaka Amarasinghe and Niran Anketell instructed by Julius & Creasy for the 6th Respondent. ARGUED ON: 31.05.2018 DECIDED ON: 26.06.2018 ALUWIHARE PC, J: When this matter was taken up for support the learned Presidents Counsel

for the 6th Respondent challenging the maintainability of this application,

raised four preliminary objections which are as follows:

(1) The Petitioner has suppressed material, in that the Petitioner had not

made full disclosure of the earlier case filed on the same matter,

namely SC FR Application No.447/2017.

(2) The Petitioners application is time barred.

(3) The same matter has been urged before this Court earlier.

(4) 2nd, 4th, 7th and 8th Respondents cited in this application are neither

juristic nor natural persons and as such, this application is

misconceived in law.

12

All parties were heard on the preliminary objections referred to above.

The learned Addl. Solicitor General representing the Respondents save for

the 6th Respondent, submitted that he subscribes to the views expressed on

behalf of the 6th Respondent as to the preliminary objections.

Of the objections raised, the 2nd objection raised on behalf of the 6th

Respondent, was that this application was time barred.

It was the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the 6th

Respondent that the Petitioner had invoked the jurisdiction of this court in

terms of Article 126 of the Constitution and sought the same relief against

the Respondents in a previous case; SC FR 447/17. It was pointed out that

the subject matter and the reliefs claimed in the present application are

identical to those in SC FR 447/17.When one peruses the petition filed in

Application SC FR 447/17 and the petition of the instant Application, it is

evident that save for paragraphs 11, 36 and 40, all other averments in the

petition of SC FR 447/17 are reproduced verbatim in the petition of the

present application. Even the relief prayed in both applications save for

minor variations, is identical.

According to the Petition in the present application, the complaint in the

main is that, the approval given by the Cabinet of Ministers in granting the

e-MRP Project to the 6th Respondent as reflected in the Cabinet

Memorandum dated 2nd November, 2017 (P9) and the Cabinet decision

(P9A) breaches and continues to breach the Petitioners fundamental

rights guaranteed under Articles 12 (1) and 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution

(Paragraph 35 of the Petition).

13

Paragraph 35 of the petition in the instant case corresponds to paragraph

34 of the petition in the case filed earlier, (SC FR 447/17) which are

substantially the same. In the averment in paragraph 34, the Petitioner only

alleges that the said action of the Cabinet of Ministers was in breach of the

fundamental rights of the Petitioners and had not alleged a continuous

breach as in the instant application. If the violation alleged by the

Petitioners was a continuous breach of their fundamental rights, I cannot

see any valid reason for them not to have pleaded so in the SC FR Application

447/2017.

In paragraph 40 of the present petition, the Petitioners have admitted that

they had invoked the jurisdiction of this court previously in respect of this

matter in case No. SC FR 447/2017 which had been filed on the 4th

December 2017. The Petitioners state (in paragraph 40) that when the

matter was taken up for support on 8th March, 2018, the Hon. Attorney

General challenged the maintainability of the said application and in the

face of the objections so raised the Petitioners withdrew the said application

reserving the right to file a fresh application.

As referred to earlier, the main complaint of the Petitioners is that the

Cabinet of Ministers, without calling for open tenders, granted the e-MRP

project to the 6th Respondent via direct contracting method by the Cabinet

decision dated 7th November 2017 (P9A) pursuant to Cabinet Memorandum

submitted by the Hon. Minister of Telecommunication and Digital

Infrastructure the 3rd Respondent, dated 2nd November, 2017 (P9).

The Cabinet decision (P9A) without any ambiguity reflects that the Cabinet

approval had been granted to engage the 6th Respondent to implement the

14

e-Passport project. The Petitioners have averred that they became aware of

the Cabinet Memorandum dated 2nd November, 2017 (P9) on or about 23rd

November, 2017.

It is on that premises aforesaid, that the Petitioners alleged, in SC FR

application No.447/17, that the Cabinet Memorandum (P9) and the Cabinet

decision (P9A) was in breach of the Petitioners Fundamental Rights

guaranteed under Articles 12 (1) and 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution. The SC

FR 447/17 which was pro forma dismissed, had been filed on 5th December,

2017. The said application was well within the time stipulation of 30 days

from the infringement alleged, prescribed under Article 126 of the

Constitution to invoke the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this court.

The Petitioners by filing the present application had invoked the jurisdiction

of this court on 12th March 2018 which is clearly outside the stipulation of

time referred to above. They claim that the Petition is not time-barred as

there is a continuous violation. However, in the same vein, the learned

counsel for the petitioners contended that if open tenders are called for the

e-MRP project even at this stage, the Petitioners are prepared to withdraw

this application. Thus, what the Petitioners attempt to achieve is to re-open

a process that reached its completion. This clearly demonstrates that the

alleged violation, in contrast to what is claimed by the Petitioners, took place

when the Cabinet of Ministers took the decision to engage the 6th Respondent

for the project on 7th November 2017, roughly 4 months before filing the

present application. As such I cannot agree with the argument of the learned

counsel for the Petitioners, that the said Cabinet decision continues to

breach the Petitioners fundamental rights.

15

As such I uphold the 2nd preliminary objection (time bar) raised on behalf

of the 6th Respondent and hold further that this application cannot be

maintained due to that reason.

In view of the finding above, I see no reason to consider other objections

raised on behalf of the Respondents.

Accordingly, this application is dismissed and in the circumstance of this

case I make no order as to costs.
