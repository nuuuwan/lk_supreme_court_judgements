This Plan 164 was a final partition plan of the Partition Action No. 2775/NP which was heard and concluded in the District Court of Balapitiya. The Plaintiffs claimed that they were legally entitled to Lot 1 of the said plan with the right of way through Lot 12. The Defendants filed answer denying all the averments in the Plaint and prayed for a dismissal of the action. However the Plaintiffs raised 7 issues and the Defendants raised 3 issues at the commencement of the trial. The Plaintiffs took out a commission on a Surveyor namely, Gunasiri Mendis and he produced Plan No. 4047 and gave evidence at the trial. The Defendants also took out a commission on a surveyor named Victor Godahena and he produced Plan No. 518. The subject matter of this action is the \u2018 access roadway \u2019 claimed by the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs allege that this roadway was encroached by the Defendants. The 1st Plaintiff Bhadralatha gave evidence of this encroachment and two Policemen also gave evidence on their behalf at the trial. Furthermore, on behalf of the Plaintiff, the surveyor Delath Gunasiri Mendis of 70 years of age, the Court Commissioner gave evidence and produced the Plan No. 4074 dated 03.05.1995 marked as X and the report thereon marked as X1. While giving evidence he had produced to court certified copies of two other survey plans which were used by him to make Plan No. 4074 by superimposing the said Plans on the Plan he had made. The said certified copies of Plans were marked as X2 and X3 which are respectively Plans Nos. 1778 done by the surveyor Garvin de Silva and 164 done by the surveyor A.G.F. Perera. The Plaintiffs closed their case marking in evidence, documents X, X1 ,X2, X3 and P1 to P13 through four witnesses. The 1st Defendant , Mallika, surveyor Victor Godahena and Waradana Sarath Samarajeeva de Silva, a member of the Pradeshiya Sabha were the three witnesses who gave evidence for the defense. The surveyor and court commissioner Victor Godahena giving evidence marked the superimposed plan 518 as Z. He stated that he used Plan X2 for superimposition. That is the Plan 164 as aforementioned which was already marked by the surveyor who gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiffs. The defense had marked documents V1 to V10 and Plan Z.",

    "text": "On 30.01.2008, the District Judge dismissed the Plaintiffs\u2019 action without costs on the ground that the roadway claimed by the Plaintiffs was not properly identified. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the Plaintiffs appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court. After hearing both parties and having considered the written submissions of both parties, the High Court Judges dismissed the Appeal on 21.01.2014. The basis on which the learned High Court Judge had done so, is that the Plan on which the rights of the Plaintiffs are identified has not been produced before the trial court for its consideration. I find that the Plan 4074 dated 03.05.1995 made by Licensed Surveyor and the Court Commissioner who was issued with a commission by the District Court at the instance of the Plaintiffs is marked as \u201cX\u201d and produced. It is in page 246 of the brief. This Plan clearly shows the house and the land in which the Plaintiffs live, (adjacent to the rail road reservation) which is Lot 1 in Plan No. 164 and the access road which is Lot 12 in Plan No. 164, ending at the entrance to the block of land marked Lot 1 which belongs to the Plaintiffs. The surveyor Gunasiri Mendis had superimposed Plan No. 164 relied on by the Plaintiffs and Plan No. 1178 containing Lots 32 and 33 within that area which is relied on by the Defendants, on the total area surveyed by him and identified that the Defendants had encroached on the access road. The surveyor had shown the encroached areas as Lot A of an extent of \u00bd a Perche and Lot B of an extent of 1 Perch and marked in red and green lines. Then the Plaintiffs have marked the report of the survey X written by Gunasiri Mendis as X1 and it is at pages 250 and 251 of the brief. The Plans which were superimposed are Plan 164 and Plan 1778. Plan 164 and its report are marked as X3 which is at page259 and its report is at page 258. This plan is dated 8.3.1973 and done by surveyor A.G.F. Perera. Plan No. 1778 dated as partitioned on 17.07.1975 is marked as X2 and it is at page 257 of the brief.

In the judgment of the District Judge, issues 1 and 2 have been answered in the affirmative and as such the Plaintiffs have been held to have good title to Lots 1 and 12 of Plan 164 as in the Schedules to the Plaint. The learned trial judge has erred when he went on to find that the end of the roadway is not correctly depicted in the Commission Plan of the Plaintiff whereas the Plaintiffs contended only \u2018 that the access roadway was encroached by the Defendants and that the same be removed\u201d. Anyway the learned District Judge had correctly answered the issues and affirmed the position that the Lot 12 of the Partition Plan No. 164 is a roadway used by the Plaintiffs; the said roadway has been encroached upon by the Defendants and that the said encroachments have been identified as \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 in the Commission Plan No. 4074. The Civil Appellate High Court has arrived at an incredible conclusion that Plan No. 164 was not marked and produced at the trial before the District Court.
