Accused-Appellant-Petitioner.

ARGUED & DECIDED ON : 18.07.2018

Sisira J. de Abrew, J.

Heard both Counsel in support of their respective

cases.

In this case the Accused was charged in the

Magistrates Court for an offence under Section 314 of the Penal Code.

After trial, the learned Magistrate convicted the Accused-Appellant and

sentenced him to 01 year Rigorous Imprisonment and to pay a fine of

Rs. 1000/-.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the

sentence the Accused-Appellant appealed to the High Court and the

learned High Court Judge by his judgment dated 18/05/2010

dismissed the appeal affirming the conviction and the sentence. Being

aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned High Court Judge, the

Accused-Appellant has appealed to this Court.

This Court by its order dated 25/10/2010 granted

leave to appeal on questions of law set out in paragraphs 23 (b), (e) and

(f) of the petition of appeal dated 28/06/2010. The said questions of

SC. Appeal No. 140/2010

3

law are set out below:-

1). Did the learned High Court Judge err in concluding that the

contradictions and omissions marked do not go to the root of

the case for the prosecution, when the said contradictions

and omissions seriously affect the credibility of the

witnesses?

2). Did the learned High Court Judge misdirect himself when he

failed to consider that the medical evidence did not support

the version of the prosecution?

3). Did the learned High Court Judge fail to consider that the

charge preferred against the Petitioner was illegal in that the

charge framed against the Petitioner is bad for duplicity and

no valid trial could have been held on such a charge?

The facts of this case may be briefly summarized as

follows: the Complainant, Nishantha Vidura Kumarawadu, his wife and

his brother were travelling in a car on 25th of August 2001. The name

of the brother is Banu Kumarawadu. Banu Kumarawadu who drove

the car overtook a double cab. Thereafter double cab overtook the car

and stopped the double cab in a way that the car could not move.

Thereafter inmates of the double cab got down from the double cab and

the Accused who is a police officer assaulted both Nishantha Vidura

Kumarawadu and Banu Kumarawadu. Thereafter they were taken to

the Welikada Police Station.

Version of the Accused-Appellant is quite different from

SC. Appeal No. 140/2010

4

the version of the prosecution. The Accused-Appellant in his evidence

took up the position that the vehicle driven by Banu Kumarawadu

failed to stop when he was signaled to stop by a police officer at a road

block and as such the said police officer gave chase to the car driven by

Banu Kumarawadu and stopped the car. Later the inmates of the car

were taken to the Welikada Police Station. After they were taken to the

Welikada Police Station they were produced before the Judicial Medical

Officer. The Judicial Medical Officer in his report has stated that

Nishantha Vidura Kumarawadu had received two abrasions.

Learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the

Accused-Appellant submits that contradictions in the evidence had not

been considered by the learned Magistrate. He submits that

Nishantha Vidura Kumarawadu in his evidence has stated that he was

in a hurry to meet a doctor regarding his mothers surgery but his

brother has said that they were coming from hospital. Therefore

learned Presidents Counsel submits that this is a serious contradiction

that goes to the route of the case.

Learned Presidents Counsel brought to our notice a

contradiction with regard to the place where the assault took place.

One witness says it is near the double cab and the other witness says it

is near the car. Learned Presidents Counsel submits that this

contradiction is a vital contradiction.

In considering the submissions of learned Presidents

Counsel with regard to the contradiction, I am guided by the judgment

in Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai V. State of Gujarat AIR 1983 SC 753

wherein Indian Supreme Court held as follows:-

SC. Appeal No. 140/2010

By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photo

graphic memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as

if a video tape is replayed on the mental screen.

. Ordinarily it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The

Witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often

has an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot

be expected to attuned to absorb the details.

The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one

may notice, another may not. An object or movement might

emboss its image on one persons mind, whereas it might go

unnoticed on the part of another.

Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the

sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a

short time span. A witness is liable to get confused, or mixed up

when interrogated later on.

We note that learned Magistrate who heard the case

has considered all the above contradictions and the learned High Court

Judge has also considered the said contradictions. We note that the

learned Magistrate who heard the case has convicted the Accused.

Therefore the learned Magistrate who saw the deportment and

demeanor of the witnesses has the opportunity to assess the evidence.

In this regard I would like to consider a judgment of the Privy Counsil

reported in 20 NLR page 282 Fradd V. Brown & Co. Ltd. wherein the

Privy Counsil held as follows:-

SC. Appeal No. 140/2010

It is rare that a decision of a Judge so express, so explicit,

upon a point of fact purely, is over-ruled by a Court of Appeal,

because Courts of Appeal recognize the priceless advantage

which a Judge of first instance has in matters of that kind, as

contrasted with any Judge of a Court of Appeal, who can only

learn from paper or from narrative of those who were present. It

is very rare that, in questions of veracity, so direct and so

specific as these, a Court of Appeal will over-rule a Judge of first

instance.

In Alwis V. Piyasena Fernado [1993] 1 SLR 119 His

Lordship Justice G. P.S. de Silva, Chief Justice made the following

observation; it is well established that findings of primary facts by a

trial Judge who hears and sees witnesses are not to be lightly

disturbed on appeal

When I consider the above judicial literature and the

contradiction that had been brought to the notice of this Court, I hold

that the contradictions submitted by learned Presidents Counsel are

not vital and they do not go to the root of the case. For the above

reasons, I reject the said contention of learned Presidents Counsel.

Learned Presidents Counsel next contended that the

charge leveled against the Accused is defective. Learned Presidents

Counsel contended that name of two persons had been stated in the

charge sheet as injured persons and therefore charge was defective.

The Accused-Appellant has not raised an objection to the charge at the

trial. In the first place we note that at page 97, the Accused-Appellant

has admitted that he knows about the charge. As I pointed out earlier

SC. Appeal No. 140/2010

7

the Accused-Appellant has failed to raise any objections to the charge

at the trial. In this regard I rely on the judgment of the Court of

Criminal Appeal in 45 NLR page 82 in King V. Kitchilan wherein

the Court of Criminal appeal held as follows:

The proper time at which an objection of the nature should be

taken is before the accused has pleaded

It is well settled law that if a charge sheet is defective,

objection to the charge sheet must be raised at the very inception.

In this connection I would like to consider Section 166

of the Criminal Procedure Code which reads as follows:-

Any error in stating either the offence or the particulars

required to be stated in the charge and any omission to state

the offence or these particulars shall not be regarded at any

stage of the case as material, unless the accused was misled by

such error or omissions.

In Wickramasinghe V. Chandradasa 67 NLR 550 His Lordship

Justice Sriskandarajah observed the following facts;

Where in a report made to Court under Section 148(1) (b) of the

Criminal Procedure Code, the Penal Provision was mentioned

but, in the charge sheet from which the accused was charged,

the penal provision was not mentioned. His Lordship held as

follows:- The omission to mention in a charge sheet the penal

Section is not a fatal irregularity if the accused has not been

SC. Appeal No. 140/2010

8

misled by such omission. In such a case Section 171 of the

Criminal Procedure Code is applicable.

In this case has the Accused been misled? As I

pointed out earlier Accused-Appellant in his evidence at page 97

admitted that he understood the charge. Therefore I hold that Accused

had not been misled by the said defect in the charge sheet.

For the above reasons I reject the contention of

learned Presidents Counsel.

Learned Presidents Counsel next contended that the

medical evidence has not supported the version of the prosecution. But

we note that the Judicial Medical Officer in his report has stated that

Nishantha Vidura Kumarawadu has received two abrasions. Further at

page 69 of the brief, learned Counsel who appeared for the Accused-

Appellant at the trial has admitted the medico legal report without the

doctor being called. PW1 in his evidence has referred to injuries which

he received in his both arms. Therefore we hold that the evidence

relating to injuries stated by witness Nishantha Vidura Kumarawadu

has been corroborated by medical evidence.

When I consider all the above matters, I am unable to

agree with the contention of learned Presidents Counsel. For the above

reasons I reject the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel.

Relying on the above judicial literature stated in Frad

Vs. Brown and Alwis Vs. Piyasena Fernando 1993 1 SLR 119, we hold

that the findings of the trial Judge who had the opportunity of

SC. Appeal No. 140/2010

9

observing demeanor and deportment of witnesses should not be easily

disturbed.

When I consider all the above matters, I answer the

questions of law raised by the Accused-Appellant in the negative. For

all the above reasons I hold that there is no ground to interfere with the

judgment of the learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate.

We affirm the judgment of the learned High Court Judge and the

learned Magistrate. We affirm the conviction and the sentence and

dismiss this appeal.

Registrar of this Court is directed to send certified

copies of this Judgment to the relevant High Court, Magistrates Court,

Hon. Attorney General and the Inspector General of Police forthwith.

Appeal dismissed.
