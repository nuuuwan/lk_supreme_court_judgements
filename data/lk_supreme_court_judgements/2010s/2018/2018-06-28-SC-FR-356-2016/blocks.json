The 5th Respondent has accordingly expressed his dissatisfaction to the 8th Respondent and had expressed his fear about the capabilities of the Petitioner to handled matters pertaining to the construction of the new building at the said school premises. No doubt that the 8th Respondent should have taken cognizance of the said fact and taken steps to remedy the situation. But instead of exercising her powers independently and objectively, the 8th Respondent had proceeded immediately to transfer the Petitioner from the said school to please the 5th Respondent which is wrong. In my opinion this was a duty which the 8th Respondent herself had to perform. In exercising that discretion the 8th Respondent could not abdicate her judgment in favour of anyone else however powerful that person may be. In Administrative Law if the person who has the power exercises his or her power wrongly, then such act or decision is ultra vires.",
