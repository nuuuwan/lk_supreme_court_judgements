Counsel: Chethiya Gunasekara Deputy Solicitor General for Complainant-Respondent-Appellant,

R. Arsecularatne PC, with Namal Karunaratne, Udara Muhamdiramge, Ganeshan

Premakumar and Thilina Punchihewa for Accused-Appellant-Respondent,

Argued on: 21.07.2017

Decided on: 20.02.2018

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J The accused-appellant-Respondent (here-in-after referred to as the Respondent) namely

Bimbirigodage Sujith Lal was indicted before the High Court of Galle for the murder of one

Udumalagala Gamage Punyawathy on or a about 20th July 1997 at Baddegama, an offence

punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code.

The trial against the Respondent was commenced before High Court Judge of Galle without a jury

and at the conclusion of the said trial, the Learned High Court Judge had convicted the

Respondent, and sentenced to death.

Being dissatisfied with the said conviction and sentence, the Respondent had preferred an appeal

to the Court of Appeal. When the said appeal was taken up for argument before the Court of

Appeal, it had transpired that the Learned trial Judge had failed to follow the provisions of section

195 (ee) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

As revealed before us, both the learned President’s Counsel who represented the Respondent and

the learned Deputy Solicitor General who represented the Attorney General had accepted the

position that the journal entry and proceedings dated 04.11.2004 demonstrate, the compliance

with subsection 195 (ee) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

3 In this regard this court is mindful of the decision by this court in the case of Attorney General V.

Segulebbe and Another 2008 1 Sri LR 225, where the Supreme Court considered the Provisions in

section 195 (ee) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act as follows;

“This amendment necessitated an introduction of a further amendment i.e. section 195

(ee) imposing a duty on the trial judge to inquire from the accused at the time of serving

the indictment whether or not the accused can elects to be tried by a jury. This is in

recognition of the basic right of an accused to be tried by his peers. It is left to the

discretion of the accused to decide as to who should try him.

As pointed out earlier for nearly two hundred long years the jury system has been in

existence in Sri Lanka with whatever the faults it had. I do not make an endeavour to

discuss the merits and the demerits of the jury system. As long as it is in the statute book

that the accused can elect to be tried by a jury, the trial judge has an obligation not only to

inquire from him whether he is to be tried by a jury, judge must also inform that the

accused has a legal right to that effect. Non observance of this procedure is an illegality

and not a mere irregularity and proceeded to quash the conviction and sentence imposed

on the accused.”

However in the said case the parties agreed before the Supreme Court for a retrial before the High

Court on the same Indictment.

After both parties accepted the above position, the learned Deputy Solicitor General moved court

to set aside the conviction and to send the case back to the High Court of Galle for a retrial on the

same indictment. At that stage, the learned President’s Counsel who represented the accused-

appellant in the Court of Appeal, without agreeing for the said request by the state, took a further

step by addressing court and pursing his case on the footing that, justice to his client would be

denied due to a long laps of time, if a fresh trial is to be held and moved that the accused-

appellant should acquitted and the appeal be allowed accordingly.

As revealed before us, both parties contested their respective cases before the Court of Appeal

and the Court of Appeal by its decision dated 20.10.2014 allowed the appeal by acquitting the

Respondent. Being dissatisfied with the said acquittal, the Attorney General preferred the present

appeal before the Supreme Court.

4 When the matter was supported for special leave, this court had decided to grant special leave on

the question of law referred to in paragraph 18 (c) of the Petition, which reads as follows;

18 (c) “Did the Court of Appeal err in law by failing to order a retrial in this case”

As observed by this court when this matter was taken up before the Court of Appeal, the court

had very correctly observed that, the material available before court clearly demonstrate that

there is non-compliance with the subsection 195 (ee) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the

court has no option but to set aside the conviction and the sentence and send the case back to the

High Court for due compliance with the said section and to commence a fresh trail (trial do novo),

but finally concluded after giving consideration to a series of cases decided both by the Court of

Appeal and the Supreme Court, to acquit the accused-appellant (Respondent) instead of sending

the case back to the High Court for due compliance and to commence a fresh trial.

In the said decision the Court of Appeal after considering the decisions both by the Court of

Appeal and Supreme Court which I will also consider at a later stage of this judgment, had finally

concluded as follows;

“A long delay to finally conclude the matter is a relevant factor to be taken in to

consideration. The conviction and sentence may be so deserving. But court cannot forget

the fact that when a fresh trial is ordered by the Appellate Court the accused is tried for

the second time, and the process has to be undertaken all over again. The second trial if at

all would be after a long lapse of time of over 17 years and after the accused by law was

incarcerated and spent 8 years in prison custody. One cannot forget the fact that all this

happened due to no fault of the accused party but for a procedural irregularity in the

Administration of Justice itself. Good part of the blame goes to the system and not the

accused who is called upon to be tried one more.

A fair trial is a worldwide recognized concept to an accused and could never be denied, in

our country.

In this instance long delay would result in serious consequences and disorganization to the

accused as well as the prosecution party and witnesses. My view as above would apply to

the case in hand, and I should not be understood or misunderstood to state that this is the

rule. This is a decision to be taken, having regard to all the circumstances and

5

consequences, and such decision can be taken only on a case by case basis. In all the above

facts and circumstances we set aside the conviction and sentence, and acquit the accused-

appellant.”

In the said decision the Court of Appeal when decided to acquit the Respondent after setting aside

the conviction and sentence, was of the view that, the long delay in the instant case would result

in serious consequences and disorganization to the accused as well as the prosecution party and

the witnesses but, emphasized that, it should not be understood or misunderstood to state that

this is the rule and the decision to be taken having regard to all the circumstances and

consequences, and such decision can be taken only on a case by case basis.

However during the argument before us, the learned Deputy Solicitor General who represented

the Attorney General took up the position that, when deciding to acquit the Respondent, the

Court of Appeal failed to consider the circumstances in favour of the ordering of a retrial but had

only considered the circumstance in favour of acquitting the Respondent even though it was

observed by Court of Appeal that the said decision to be taken having regard to all the

circumstances on a case basis.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General whilst agreeing with the observation in the Court of Appeal

Judgment that “ it should not be understood or misunderstood to state that this is the rule and

the decision to be taken having regard to all the circumstances and consequence and such

decision can be taken only on a case by case basis”, further submitted that the circumstances in

the case in hand are as such, it warrants a decision by the court to order a retrial insted of

acquitting the Respondent.

In the above context, it is important to consider the evidence led at the said trial, in order to

consider whether the circumstances warrants an acquittal as against ordering a retrial as required

by the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

As revealed from the evidence led before the trial court, the deceased was at home with her

eldest daughter who was 16 years and was studying for her G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examination. The

deceased’s husband had gone on an office trip with their other two children and the deceased’s

father had come to stay with them in the absence of the husband from home. Around 7.00 p.m.

on the day in question, whilst the daughter of the deceased was studying, she had heard the front

6 door being opened. The lights in the house were on and somebody had opened her room door

and when she looked, she had seen the Respondent peeping into her room. When she called out

to her mother, she had seen the accused walking towards the kitchen.

In few seconds she heard the Respondent talking to her mother. According to the evidence of

Kumudu Rasangika the daughter of the deceased, she had known the accused for a long time and

also knew that he was interested in her.

The witness had been listing to the conversation between her mother and the Respondent. The

witness had narrated what she heard at that time as follows (Page 29 of the High Court Brief)

From the above evidence it transpires that the witness Kumudu Rasangka had not seen the

stubbing but had given strong evidence with regard to the following facts,

a) That she had seen the accused few second prior to the stubbing, going towards the kitchen

b) That she overheard the conversation between her mother and the accused where she

heard her mother saying that “she is not afraid of the knife”

c) That she saw the accused running away from the kitchen where her mother was, with a

knife in hand

d) At that time she saw her mother holding to her chest and told her that she was stubbed

e) When inquired, mother made a dying deposition to the effect, “iQálald msysfhka wekakd”

When the above evidence is considered along with the evidence of the father of the deceased

who rushed home without going to buy some betel after hearing the cries of his grand-daughter to

the effect “wïudg msysfhka wekakd iQálald” saw the accused running away from the kitchen, it

appears that there is a strong case based on circumstantial evidence against the Respondent for

the brutal killing of the mother of witness Kumudu Rasangika.

With regard to the identify, witness Rasangika had clearly identified the Respondent (who is a

neighbor) with the help of the lights burning inside the house and the kitchen. Deceased’s father

8 too had no difficulty in identifying the Respondent with the help of the lights burning in the

kitchen since he had met the Respondent, once in the morning on the same day.

As further submitted by the learned Deputy Solicitor General the above positions taken by the two

witnesses were also corroborated by the medical evidence and from the evidence of the police

officers who conducted the investigations. In addition to the strong items of circumstantial

evidence referred to above there is clear evidence of motive for the Respondent to commit the

offence, even though there is no requirement to establish the motive in a criminal trial.

The importance in establishing motive in a criminal trial was discussed by the Supreme Court of

India in the case of Chandra Prakash Shahi V. State of the U.P. (2000) 5SCC 152; AIR 2000 SC 1706

as follows;

“Motive is the moving power which impels action for a definite results or which incites or

stimulates a person do an act”

and the extent to which the motive can be established in a criminal trial as discussed by

the Indian Supreme Court in the case of Nathuni Yadav V. State of Bihar (1998) 9SCC 288 AIR

1997 AC 1808 as follows;

“Motive for doing a criminal act is generally a difficult area for prosecution. One cannot

normally see into the mind of another. Motive is the emotion which impels a man do a

particular act. Such impelling cause need not necessarily be proportionally grave to do

grave crimes. Many murders have been committed without known or prominent motive. It

is quite possible that the aforesaid impelling factor would remain undiscoverable. Through,

it is a second proposition that every criminal act is done with a motive, it is unsound to

suggest that no such criminal act can be presumed unless motive is proved.”

However as submitted by the learned Deputy Solicitor General, the evidence led on behalf of the

prosecution clearly established the motive for committing the offence and when the strong

circumstantial evidence including the clear evidence of motive is taken together there is over

whelming evidence to establish the case beyond reasonable doubt.

9 When considering the evidence placed before the trial court as discussed above, I agree with the

Learned Deputy Solicitor General when he submitted that there was a strong prima facia case

against the Respondent for the murder of the deceased Udumalagala Gamage Punyawathy.

Whilst referring to some of the decisions relied upon by the Court of Appeal, in coming to the

conclusion of acquitting the Respondent, the learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the

decisions in those cases cannot influenced the decision in the case in hand, since the decisions in

those cases were influenced due to the nature of the evidence available in those cases. In the

regard the Learned Deputy Solicitor General heavily relied on the following decision considered by

the Court of Appeal in the impugned order,

Seenithamby V. Jansz 47 NLR 496

Judicial notice will not be taken that a “Food Control Guard” is a public servant within the

meaning of section 183 of the Penal Code or that he was duly appointed under Regulation

6 of the Defence (purchase of foodstuffs) Regulations, 1942

The Court of Appeal will not order a new trial where the proceedings are so irregular that

the court by according to a request for a new trial will merely encourage slackness,

negligence and inexactitude on the part of prosecutions.

At page 499….

I have been asked to send back the case as against the first to the sixth accused on count 2

for a new trial. I do not think I shall be justified in so doing. To accede to such a request will

merely encourage slackness, negligence and inexactitude on the part of prosecutors.

It is always necessary to bear in mind that the power given to a trial judge to express

opinions on questions of fact must be used cautiously, more so in respect of the

uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. Although at the commencement of the

summing the learned Commissioner made some preliminary observations which were

extremely appropriate to a case of this nature, and which correctly directed the jury on

their proper function a judges of fact, we cannot escape the feeling that the total effect of

10

his later strong expressions of opinion obliterated the good effect of the preliminary

observations.

Finally, we quote the following words from that judgment as they express our view of the

learned Commissioner’s summing-up. “The summing-up as a whole cannot be accepted as

a fair presentation of the case to the jury. A fair presentation is essential to a fair trial by

jury. The appellant(s) (have) thus been deprived of the substance of a fair trial.”

For these reasons we allow the appeals and quash the conviction of the appellants. We

have considered whether we should order a new trial in this case. We do not take that

course, because there has been already a lapse of over three years since the commission of

the offences, and because of our own view of the unreliable nature of the accomplice’s

evidence on which alone the prosecution rests. We accordingly direct that a judgment of

acquittal be entered.

However when going through the impugned judgment, this court observes that, the Court of

Appeal was not only mindful of decisions where re-trials were not ordered due to lack of evidence

but also mindful of decisions where re-trial was not ordered for delay only (CA 146/2010) and also

directing a re-trial with specific directions to conclude the re-trial early since there was a laps over

9 years (CA 128-130/91).

I too had the opportunity of going through several other judgments, both by the Supreme Court

and the Court of Appeal, where re-trials have been ordered for similar reasons R.M. Ranbanda V.

The State SC. SPL LA 65/09, Nimal Banda V. The State 1996 1 SLR 214, Rajah and Another V.

Republic of Sri Lanka 1996 2 SLR 403 CA 93/2007, CA 24/2004 but, I could not find a single case

where the date of offence goes far back as 1997 for nearly 20 years. After 20 years what this court

will have to now consider is not a delay but a ‘long delay’ in ordering a fresh trial.

As discussed above there is strong evidence against the Respondent which warrants a conviction

and sentence but this court cannot simply ignore the fact that he had gone through a full trial,

convicted and was in remand custody pending the appeal nearly 8 years for no fault of him but

merely for a procedural irregularity in the Administration of Justice itself. Now after 20 years can

this court order a fresh trial to begin against him.

11 As rightly observed by the Court of Appeal, it is not only the Respondent (accused in the original

indictment) is disturbed from the said order, witness No 1 the daughter of the deceased who

witnessed the said incident when she was only 16 years; too will be prejudiced, if she was asked to

give evidence once again after 20 years. Whether she could remember everything happened 20

years before, to give evidence in a fresh trial where she will be subject to cross examination by the

opponents, is also a matter to be mindful by court.

In these circumstances I observe that the Court of Appeal when deciding to acquit the Respondent

has considered all the circumstances and consequences relevant to the case in hand.

In the said circumstances I answer the question of law raised by the appellant in negative and

dismiss this appeal.
