When this matter was taken up for the consideration of granting leave to

proceed with the application, learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that

the two affidavits affirmed to by Brandigampolage Hemantha Prasanna Perera

and Adithep Sajjaviriyapong which were annexed to the petition dated

24.03.2016 contain plethora false material and also contradictions. In support

of her submissions, she referred to the matters contained in paragraphs 1& 4

to 14, 39 to 43 of the two affidavits dated 24.03.2016 affirmed to by the aforesaid

Brandigampolage Hemantha Prasanna Perera and Adithep Sajjaviriyapong.

Accordingly, she argued that the petitioners cannot have and maintain this

application since the petitioners have failed to file valid affidavits as required by

Article 126 (2) of the Constitution which is to be read with the Rule 44 (1) (c)

found in Part 4 of the Supreme Court Rules 1990.

Basically, the objection of the learned Deputy Solicitor General is that

there is no valid affidavit filed by the petitioners for them to proceed with this

application. The objection so raised poses two questions to be looked at. First

issue is whether the two affidavits filed in this case would amount to non

existence of an affidavit due to the inclusion therein of false material and the

3

second being the issue as to the requirement of an affidavit when invoking

jurisdiction under Article 126 (2) of the Constitution.

I will now advert to the first issue namely the validity of the affidavit due

to the inclusion of false material therein. Manner in which an oath or an

affirmation is to be administered in an affidavit is described in the Oaths

Ordinance No.9 of 1895 as amended. Section 12 of that Ordinance stipulates

thus:

A Commissioner for Oaths appointed under this Ordinance may

administer any oaths or affirmation or take any affidavit for the

purpose of any legal proceedings or otherwise in all cases in which

a Justice of the Peace is authorized by law so to do ...

The aforesaid Ordinance also provides for punishment on the persons

who willfully or dishonestly swears or affirms falsehood in any oath or

affirmation administered or taken for the purpose of any legal proceedings.

However, it is to be noted that nothing is mentioned in that Ordinance, as to an

affidavit becoming invalid when false material is included in such an affidavit.

If the oath or affirmation had been properly administered or taken before a

Justice of the Peace then it will become a valid affidavit made under and in

terms of the Oaths Ordinance. Basically, criteria in determining the question of

the existence of an affidavit depend on the manner in which the oath or

affirmation was administered.

4

In this instance, there is no allegation as to the manner in which the

affirmation of the deponents in the two affidavits was administered. Jurat in

those affidavits has not been challenged either. Steps referred to in the Oaths

Ordinance that is to be followed at the time, the affirmation of the deponents

was administered by the Justice of Peace had been complied with. Therefore, it

is clear that the affidavits filed in these proceedings cannot be considered as

invalid. Accordingly, the two affidavits filed in this case are to be considered as

valid affidavits though allegations had been made stating that it contains false

material.

Inclusion of false material in the two affidavits is a matter that should be

looked at by Court when considering the facts of the case. Section 13 of the

Oaths Ordinance also provides as to the manner in which it is to be dealt with

when false material is brought into an affidavit. Accordingly, for the reasons

set out above, I am not inclined to accept the position that there is no valid

affidavit filed with the petition in this instance.

The next question is whether it is mandatory to file an affidavit when

invoking jurisdiction of this Court under Article 126 (2) of the Constitution read

with Rule 44 (1) (c) of the Supreme Court Rules 1990. At this stage it is pertinent

to refer to Article 17 of the Constitution too, since it ensures the right to make

an application to the Supreme Court for relief when the fundamental rights

enshrined in Chapter III of the Constitution have been infringed or to be

infringed imminently by executive or administrative action.

5

The aforesaid Articles referred to in the Constitution provide for this Court

to exercise sole and exclusive & sui generis jurisdiction. [Jayanetti Vs. Land

Reform Commission [1984 (2) SLR 179] Therefore this Court is bound to

entertain such applications filed under Article 126(2) of the Constitution and of

course, the Court is also necessarily guided by the Rules of Procedure

stipulated in the relevant rules if available when proceeding with such an

application. Hence, it is necessary to refer to the procedure referred to in Article

126(2) of the Constitution and in Rule 44(1) (c) of the Supreme Court Rules

1990.

Article 126(2) of the Constitution reads thus:

Where any person alleges that any fundamental right or

language right relating to such person has been infringed

or is about to be infringed by executive or administrative

action, he may himself or by an attorney-at-law on his

behalf, within one month thereof, in accordance with

such rules of court as may be in force, apply to the

Supreme Court by way of a petition in writing addressed

to such Court (emphasis added)

Rule 44(1) (c) of the Supreme Court Rules 1990 reads as follows: Where any person applies to the Supreme Court by a

petition in writing, under and in terms of Article 126(2)

of the Constitution for relief or redress in respect of an

infringement or an imminent infringement of any

fundamental right or language right, by executive or

administrative action, he shall - (c) tender in support

of such petition such affidavits and documents as

are available to him. (emphasis added)

6

By looking at the Rule 44(1) (c) above, it is seen that the affidavits and/or

documents are to be produced only when those are available to the petitioner in

such an application. Obviously, it does not mean that it is essential to file those

documents with the application under Article 126(2). However, needless to say

that there should be adequate material before Court to consider an application

made to it. That material may be in the form of an affidavit or even by way of

other documents which could be relied upon. Therefore, even the literal meaning

of the Rule 44(1) does not indicate that it is mandatory to file affidavit evidence

when invoking jurisdiction of this Court under Article 126(1) of the Constitution.

Be that as it may, requirement of affidavit evidence in applications under

Article 126(1) of the Constitution had already been interpreted by this Court in

numerous occasions. In the case of Upaliratne and others vs. Tikiribanda

and others, [1995 (1) SLR 165 at 172] Dr.Amerasinghe, J has clearly stated

that there is no obligation to tender an affidavit from any one or more of the

petitioners in cases filed under Article 126(2) of the Constitution. He has clearly

said that what is required is evidence of the facts submitted through affidavits

and/or through other documents. His findings in that case are as follows:

Mr.Jayasinghe raised another objection in limine. He submitted that

the petitioners cannot have and maintain this application and/or that

the application is not properly constituted due to non-compliance with

Rule 44(1) in that all these petitioners have not given affidavits. The

obligation of a petitioner is to tender in support of the petition such

affidavits and documents as are available to him. (Rule 44(1) (c).

7

There is no obligation to tender an affidavit from any one or more of the

petitioners. What is required is evidence of the facts submitted through

affidavits and other documents. I therefore overrule the objections.

In Hewawasam Sarukkalige Rathnasiri Fernando v. Police Sergeant

Dayaratne, [SCFR 514/2010 S.C.Minutes of 15.12.2014] Priyasath

Dep.P.C.J has held thus:

The next question that arises is whether a fundamental rights

application could be dismissed due to want of an affidavit or defective

affidavit in civil cases regulated by the Civil Procedure Code whenever

there is a requirement to file a petition, the petition should be supported

by an affidavit or accompanied by an affidavit. In Article 126(2) of the

Constitution a person who invokes the jurisdiction of the Court can do

so by way of a petition. The rules require the parties to tender in

support of the petition affidavits and documents available to him. There

is no requirement that a petition should be supported by an affidavit.

The question that arises is whether an affidavit is a mandatory

requirement or not. According to the rules under certain circumstances

a person could invoke the jurisdiction of the Court by submitting a

statement or a complaint. Rule 44(7) states by way of writing a person

could bring to the notice of the court an alleged infringement or

imminent infringement of fundamental rights by executive or

administrative action the court could treat the statement/complaint as a

petition and initiate action.

In fundamental rights applications, at the time of filing a petition it need

not be supported by an affidavit. Rule 44(1) states tender in support of

8

such petition such affidavits and documents available to him.

Therefore rules require the petitioner or the complainant to provide

affidavits and documents available to him. However, for the Court to act

on facts stated in the complaint or petition in the absence of other

materials there should be evidence

By looking at the two decisions referred to above, it is clear that the issue

as to the requirement to file an affidavit with the petition in fundamental rights

applications filed under Article 126(2) have been clearly settled. Hence, it is not

necessary for me to elaborate on the issue as it had been adequately dealt with

by this Court.

In the circumstances, it is my considered opinion that it is not mandatory

to file an affidavit along with a petition filed in terms of Article 126(2) of the

Constitution. However, as mentioned in Rule 44(1) (c) of the Supreme Court

Rules 1990 the petitioners in such applications may tender affidavits and

documents that are available to them in support of their application. Unless it

is supported by those materials, the Court will not be in a position to consider

the grievance or the alleged infringement advanced by the petitioner but

certainly not on false materials as alleged in this instance.

For the aforesaid reasons, the objection raised by the Deputy Solicitor

General is overruled.

9

Petitioners are to support this application for leave of this Court on a

future date fixed by Court.

O JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

K. SRIPAVAN, CJ.

I agree.
