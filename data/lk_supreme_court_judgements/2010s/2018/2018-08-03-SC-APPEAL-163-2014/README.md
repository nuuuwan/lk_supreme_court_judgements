Complainant-Respondent- Respondents BEFORE: Buwaneka Aluwihare, PC, J Priyantha Jayawardena, PC, J & Nalin Perera, J. COUNSEL: Shanaka Ranasinghe, PC, with N.Mihindukulasooriya and Sandamali Peiris for the Accused-Appellant-Appellant. Madhawa tennakoon, SSC for the Complainant- Respondent-Respondents. ARGUED ON: 29.08.2017 DECIDED ON: 03.08.2018 ALUWIHARE, PC, J: The Accused-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as Accused-Appellant) had been charged before the Magistrates Court of Kalutara under the following counts:-

(1) Committed an offence punishable under Section 149(1) of the Motor Traffic Act by failure to avoid an accident and thereby

(2) By rash or negligent act as to endanger human life, caused grievous hurt to one Kandadurage Lalithangani Rani, an offence punishable under Section 329 of the Penal Code.

3

(3) Failed to report an accident and thereby violated Section 161(1)A(iv) of the Motor Traffic Act. Consequent to the accused appellant pleading not guilty to the charges

aforesaid, the case against the accused-appellant proceeded to trial. At the

conclusion of the trial, the learned Magistrate found the accused-appellant

guilty on counts 2 and 3 aforementioned and proceeded to convict and sentence

the accused-appellant.

The learned Magistrate imposed a term of imprisonment of three months and a

fine of Rs.1000/- on count No.2 and proceeded to suspend the operation of the

term of imprisonment for a period of five years.

With regard to the 3rd count the accused-appellant was imposed a fine of

Rs.1,500/- and a default term of one-month simple imprisonment was also

imposed.

Aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence imposed by the learned

Magistrate the accused-appellant appealed against the judgment to the High

Court.

The learned High Court Judge by his judgment dated 28th July,2014 affirmed

the conviction of the accused-appellant.

At the hearing of the appeal before the High Court it had been submitted on

behalf of the state that the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate is

inadequate when one considers the rashness and the negligence on the part of

the accused-appellant and the State moved to have the sentence imposed by the

learned Magistrate enhanced.

4

The learned High Court Judge thereupon had called on the accused-appellant

to show reasons as to why the application of the State should not be allowed.

Having heard the accused appellant on the issue of sentence, the learned High

Court Judge having set aside the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate

on count 2, substituted the same with a custodial sentence of imprisonment of

one year.

When this matter was supported, the court granted special leave on the

following questions of law: (Sub-paragraphs (b) (g) (i) and (j) of paragraph 17

of the Petition.)

(i) Has the Provincial High Court erred in Law by failing to appreciate that

the Prosecution failed to establish the degree of proof required in

establishing a charge of criminal Negligence?

(ii) Has the Provincial High Court erred in Law by affirming the

conviction without considering that the Learned Magistrate failed to

evaluate the evidence of the defence witnesses as required by the Law?

(iii) Did the Learned High Court err in Law by imposing a custodial

sentence of 1-year rigorous imprisonment on the Petitioner contrary to the

principles of sentencing?

(iv) In any event was the sentence imposed to the Petitioner is

excessive?

5

At the hearing of this appeal the learned Presidents Counsel for the accused-

appellant confined his submissions to the questions of law referred to in

paragraph (i) and (j) of paragraph 17 of the Petition [(i) and (ii) above].

It was contended on behalf of the accused-appellant that he had been employed

as a driver with the Sri Lanka Transport Board and that he had no previous

convictions. It was also contended that he is a father of three children and two

of them were engaged in higher studies.

It was also strenuously argued on behalf of the accused-appellant that the

learned High Court Judge misdirected himself with regard to the degree of

negligence that is needed to establish criminal negligence and submitted that

the principles laid down by courts suggests that the prosecution has to establish

a high degree of negligence on the part of the accused, if the accused is to be

found guilty for criminal negligence and the prosecution had not adduced

sufficient evidence to establish the degree of negligence required to convict a

person for criminal negligence.

The facts albeit briefly can be narrated as follows;

The injured who was a teacher; in order to reach the school at which she was

teaching, had taken the bus driven by the accused to come to Katukurunda

junction. Before the bus could reach the destination, however, the accused-

appellant had indicated that the bus will not proceed beyond a particular point

and wanted all the passengers to disembark. There had been about 15

passengers, and she was also in the process of getting off the bus as it was

announced that the bus would not proceed further.

6

As she was about to get off, the bus had pulled out and as a result the injured

had got thrown off the bus. Due to the impact of the fall, she had suffered a

fracture of her left wrist, among other injuries. The bus, however, had

proceeded without stopping.

In the case before us the only issue that needs to be addressed is as to whether

the learned High Court Judge was justified in enhancing the sentence. Prior to

that, the Court must first look to see whether the burden of proof has been

discharged by the Prosecution, since that is the predicate for enhancing the

sentence.

The requirement of high degree of negligence to establish criminal negligence,

referred to by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant, no doubt, was

a reference to the decision in King Vs. Leighton 47 NLR 283., where it was held

that [] in order to establish criminal liability the facts must be such that, in

the opinion of the jury, the negligence of the accused went beyond a mere

matter of compensation between subjects and showed such disregard for the

life and safety of others, as to amount to a crime against the State and conduct

deserving punishment.? a standard which was articulated by Hewart CJ in R

v Bateman (1925) 19 Cr App R 8 - later explained in Andrews v DPP [1937]

AC 576and followed by our Courts in Lourenz v Vyramuttu 42 NLR 472 and

in King v Leighton (supra).

However, as explained by Atkins J. in Andrews v DPP [1937] AC 576 and later

by Lord Mackay of Clashfern LC in Regina V Shulman, Regina V Prentice,

Regina V Adomako; Regina V Hollowa [1995] 1 AC 171, [1994] UKHL 6,

[1994] 3 WLR 288, [1994] 3 All ER 79 the circumstances in which negligence

has to be considered may make an elaborate and rather rigid directions

inappropriate. Trying to achieve a spurious precision in a branch of law, i.e,

7

criminal negligence, which extends not only to acts causing death but also hurt

and grievous hurt, the degree of circumspection as is expected of the average

man must necessarily be considered vis a vis the circumstances under a

particular situation. Although decided in the latter part of 19th century words

of OBrian J in the case of R Vs. Elliot (1889) 16 Cox 710 would be of relevance

even of today. OBrian J observed that, the degree of care to be expected from

a person, the want of which would be gross negligence or less than that, must

in the necessity of things, which the law cannot change, have some relation to

the subject and the consequences ... What OBrian J referred to, appears to be,

the want of care required, must relate to the act and the consequences.

Whether a person was negligent or not has to be considered taking into account

the facts and circumstances of each case and upon consideration of the duty of

care expected of him under the circumstances of the case. The seriousness of

the breach of duty must be judged based on the circumstances in which the

defendant was placed when it occurred. As Lord Mackay of Clashfern LC

observed in relation to the charge of manslaughter in R v Adamako (supra)

The jury will have to consider whether the extent to which the defendants

conduct departed from the proper standard of care incumbent upon him,

involving as it must have done a risk of death to the patient, was such that it

should be judged criminal. [] The essence of the matter which is supremely a

jury question is whether having regard to the risk of death involved, the

conduct of the defendant was so bad in all the circumstances as to amount in

their judgment to a criminal act or omission. This is similar to what OBrien

J said the want of care required must relate to the act and the consequences to

some degree. He went on to state that if the prisoner was absorbed in the

business and interests of the company as to give no heed to their (passengers)

safety, that might be considered as negligence. (Elliot supra at page 714). It

appears here, that OBrian J referred to an inadvertent state of mind as opposed

8

to recklessness. Particularly when one is entrusted with a responsibility such as

carrying passengers, he is expected, at all times to be mindful of the duty cast

on him and there is no room for inadvertence.

In the case before us, the accused-appellant was entrusted with the

responsibility of carrying passengers in an omnibus and had a duty of care that

by his conduct, he does not expose the passengers to any danger that would

result in any injury or harm being caused to them. Pulling away in the middle

of passengers disembarking, to say the least is grossly a rash act and, in my

view, goes beyond inadvertent state of mind that Judge OBrian spoke of in the

case of Elliot (supra).

According to the accused-appellants own admission under oath he had seen

the injured falling. The position taken up by the accused-appellant was that the

passenger fell after she got off the bus and that was the reason for him to drive

off.

The learned Magistrate had accepted the evidence of the injured and had

rejected the version of the accused-appellant and had come to the conclusion

that the bus driven by the accused-appellant had pulled off before she could

disembark and this resulted her fall, an act imminently dangerous that there

was every likelihood of a passenger falling off the bus and coupled with that,

the accused-appellant had no excuse for his course of conduct. The accused-

appellant had a duty of care to ensure safety of the passengers he carried. The

conduct of the accused-appellant is reprehensible to say the least and

sufficiently grave to fall within the ambit of criminal negligence.

Under these circumstances I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge

was correct in enhancing the sentence imposed on the accused-appellant by the

9

Magistrate and I see no reason to interfere with the same. One must bear in

mind that punitive action is not only to reform the offender but should serve as

a deterrence as well.

Chief Justice Basnayake in the case of A.G v. H. N De Silva [1955] 53 C.L.W 49

observed;

In assessing a punishment that should be passed on an offender. A judge

should consider the matter of sentence both from the point of view of the public

and the offender. Judges are too often prone to look at the question only from

the point of view from the angle of the offender. A judge should in determining

the proper sentence, first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from

the nature of the act itself and should have regard to the punishment provided

in the Penal Code or other statute under which the offender is charged. He

should also regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent and consider to

what extent it will be effective. If the offender held a position of trust or

belonged to a service which enjoys public confidence that must be taken into

account in assessing the punishment [] I have mentioned where public

interest or welfare of the state (which are synonymous) outweigh the previous

good character, antecedence and the age of the offender. Public interest must

prevail.

For the reasons set out above, I answer all the questions of law on which leave

was granted in the negative and accordingly this appeal is dismissed.

In the Petition filed before this court the accused-appellant has averred that

before he could invoke the jurisdiction of this court by way of special leave to

appeal, the learned High Court Judge directed the Magistrate concerned to

10

carry out the sentence which appears to have been complied with by the

learned Magistrate.

The court directs the learned Magistrate to ascertain from the Prison

authorities, whether the accused-appellant had served any part of the sentence

imposed by the learned High Court Judge and if so, to give necessary direction

to the Prison authorities that the accused-appellant is required to serve only the

balance part of the one-year sentence imposed, after discounting the period of

said sentence the accused-appellant had already served.
