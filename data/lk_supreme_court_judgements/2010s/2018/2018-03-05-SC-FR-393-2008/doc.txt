COUNSEL: Viran Corea with Sanita de Fonseka and Subhashini Samaraarachchi for Petitioner. Shyamal A. Collure with A.P.Jayaweera for 1st Respondent. Nayomi Wickramasekara, SSC for 2nd to 5th Respondents. ARGUED ON: 29.09.2016 DECIDED ON: 05.03.2018 ALUWIHARE, PC, J: This is an application where the Petitioner has invoked the fundamental

rights jurisdiction of this Court alleging that, 1st to the 3rd Respondents

have violated his fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.

Leave to proceed in this matter was granted on the alleged infringement

of Articles 13 (1) and 13 (2) against all Respondents while leave to

proceed was also granted on the alleged infringement of the Petitioner‟s

fundamental rights under Article 11 of the Constitution, against the 1st

and 3rd Respondents.

According to the averments in the amended Petition, the Petitioner who

had been an army officer had retired after serving 10 years, as a

lieutenant. At the time relevant to the present application, the Petitioner

had been working for a private entity called Dialog Telecom (Pvt) Ltd.

in the capacity of Human Resource Management Coordinator. It is

pertinent to note that, at the time relevant to the present application, the

Petitioner was a father of two children, one being an infant of 6 months.

3

The Petitioner who, along with his wife had come to Pettah to make

certain purchases and was proceeding towards Gunasinghapura bus

terminus with the intention of going to their residence at Ja-ela.

According to Petitioner, they had been keen to get back home without

delay because of the infant, who had to be breast fed by his wife. At one

point both had half crossed the road when a three wheeler had nearly

knocked into his wife. She had been shaken by this incident, but after a

few awkward movements, she finally had managed to cross the road

and had joined up the Petitioner. At this juncture the1st Respondent,

who had been on duty, had reprimanded the wife of the Petitioner in

foul language for the manner in which she crossed the road. The

Petitioner and his wife had ignored him and had proceeded towards

the bus stand.

The 1st Respondent at that point had beckoned to them clapping and

demanded them to approach the 1st Respondent. When they

approached the 1st Respondent the Petitioner had initially introduced

himself as an army officer and when the 1st Respondent demanded from

him the official identity card, the Petitioner had disclosed that he had

retired from service. The Petitioner alleges that the 1st Respondent

continued to use foul language and held him by the collar of his T shirt

and slapped him several times. Having dragged the Petitioner near a

police vehicle which had been parked in the vicinity, the 1st Respondent

had assaulted the Petitioner. It is alleged by the Petitioner that three

other police officers had held the Petitioner and facilitated the assault.

It is averred by the Petitioner that the 2nd Respondent happened to be

among the three police officers referred to. The Petitioner‟s wife had

tried to intervene, but had been chased away by the 1st Respondent. The

Petitioner alleges that he was bundled into the police vehicle and was

4

brought to the Dam Street Police Station where both the 1st and the 3rd

Respondents assaulted him. According to the Petitioner the 1st

Respondent had told him that they would fabricate a charge by

introducing a grenade and have him produced before the Magistrate.

The Petitioner then had pleaded with the 1st Respondent to permit him

to call his wife to check whether she had reached home safely. To his

dismay, he was not allowed, instead had been put in the police cell and

the 1st Respondent had kicked him several times.

After some time, the 1st Respondent had questioned the Petitioner about

his father-in-law who happened to be a retired police officer and the

Petitioner had been told that he would be released after producing him

before the Judicial Medical Officer and he was further advised not to

say anything to the Medical Officer.

It is the position of the Petitioner that he was traumatized by the events

of that day and fearing that he will have to face a trumped-up charge,

he had decided not to complain to the Judicial Medical Officer about

the injuries. The JMO however, had questioned the Petitioner about the

contusions and Petitioner had remained silent. The JMO had then

directed the police to admit the Petitioner to the accident ward of the

Colombo National Hospital. When he was taken to the accident ward

he had got himself released stating that he was alright and therefore he

was brought back to the police station and placed in the police cell.

The Petitioner also asserts that the attempts made by his wife and two of

his associates to visit him at the Dam Street Police Station were thwarted

by 3rd Respondent on the ground that no visits could be permitted after

9.00 p.m.

5

The Petitioner also alleges that the 1st Respondent kicked him in the

chest when he refused to place his thumb impression on two envelopes

produced by the 1st Respondent. Owing to his refusal, the Petitioner

alleges that he was dragged out of the cell and some police officers tried

forcibly to get his finger impressions on the envelopes and the 1st

Respondent, enraged by his resistance, kicked the Petitioner on the head

and the Petitioner had lost consciousness.

According to the Petitioner, he regained consciousness at the Colombo

National Hospital. He asserted that he got himself discharged from the

hospital against medical advice as the 1st Respondent had demanded

that his wife have him discharged from the hospital, if the Petitioner

does not wish to be placed on remand custody for an extended period.

After the Petitioner got himself discharged from the hospital, he had

been brought back to the police station and he had been forced to sign a

statement. He asserts that he refused to sign the statement as it carried

contents which he had not stated. The 1st Respondent had told the

Petitioner to place his signature with an endorsement “he does not

accept what had been recorded”.

The Petitioner had then been produced before the Magistrate

Maligakanda on an allegation that he possessed Cannabis in the form of

cigars and had been enlarged on bail. Thereafter the Petitioner had

been warded at the Negombo Hospital on 30th April, 2008 and had

spent a couple of days at the hospital.

6

The Petitioner had complained to this court that as a result of the

trauma he underwent he still suffers from health issues and in addition

he was unable to report for duty for three weeks. The Petitioner also

complains of the mental trauma he had undergone as a result of the

assault.

The Petitioner‟s wife Nilanga Probodhini Wanigasundera had sworn an

affidavit (P2) with regard to the events that took place on the day in

question. She had confirmed the Petitioner‟s statement as regards the

course of events that led to the incident. She had also stated that when

she came to the Dam Street Police Station she heard her husband‟s cries

of distress. She had also affirmed the events averred to by the Petitioner

regarding to the institution of proceedings before the Magistrate‟s Court

and the admission of her husband to the National Hospital, Colombo.

The Petitioner‟s father-in-law Upali Ananda Wanigasundera, an ex-

chief Inspector of Police had also sworn an affidavit in support of the

Petitioner. He had averred that he was informed by his daughter

Prabodhini Wanigasundera that the Petitioner had been taken into

custody by the Dam Street Police. He says he spoke to the 1st

Respondent over the phone and the 1st Respondent assured him that the

Petitioner would be released as soon as possible and had complained

that the Petitioner had abused him (the 1st Respondent).

He had visited the Dam Street Police Station around 6.00 a.m. on the

29th August,2008 with his daughter and had been informed that the

Petitioner had been admitted to the General Hospital. He had visited the

Petitioner at the hospital and observed that the Petitioner was

handcuffed and two constables stationed at his bedside. The Petitioner

7

had told him that after he was produced before the Judicial Medical

Officer (JMO) he was brought back to the Police Station and assaulted

again and he lost consciousness at the Police Station and he was brought

to the hospital.

Upali Wanigasundera had further averred that he returned to the

Police Station and made inquiries from Inspector Rathnayake (the1st

Respondent) about the Petitioner. The 1st Respondent had stated that he

would have the Petitioner remanded and exacerbate the situation unless

they get the Petitioner discharged from the hospital and the Petitioner

pleaded guilty to the charges that the 1st Respondent would be filed

against him.

Wanigasundera had further averred that owing to the mental trauma

his daughter and his son-in-law (the Petitioner) were undergoing, for

an early resolution of the matter, they got the Petitioner discharged

from the hospital.

The Petitioner had then been brought back to the Police Station and

subsequently produced before the Magistrate of Maligakanda.

Shanike Bhagya Udawatte, a co-employee of the Petitioner from the

place where the Petitioner was employed at the time, had also sworn an

affidavit in support of the Petitioner. He had arrived at the Dam Street

Police Station when the Petitioner‟s wife had phoned him and had been

informed of the Petitioner‟s plight. He had in his affidavit had

confirmed the account in the Petitioner‟s wife‟s affidavit and had

also averred that when he came to the Dam Street Police Station he saw

the Petitioner lying on the floor of the police cell and the Petitioner had

8

informed him that he had been assaulted by the Police and was in need

of medical attention. When he told the 3rd Respondent who was on

duty that the Petitioner needs to be attended by a doctor, the 3rd

Respondent has said that the Petitioner had already been produced

before the J.M.O.

Along with the counter affidavits the Petitioner has filed copies of his

medical reports. (P9 and annexures)

Consultant Judicial Medical Officer, Colombo Dr. Ajith Tennakoon by

his letter dated 23.07.2008 addressed to the Human Rights Commission

of Sri Lanka had informed the Commission that the Petitioner had not

been subjected to a medico legal examination by a Judicial Medical

Officer. The letter (annexed to P9) reveals that the Petitioner had been

admitted to ward 14 of the hospital (NHSL) at 1.20 a.m. on 29.04.2008

with complaints of “fainting attacks”. The doctor had attached a copy of

the Bed Head Ticket (BHT) issued to the Petitioner. He had been

admitted to hospital by the 3rd Respondent. The 3rd Respondent had

admitted this fact in the objections filed by him. The 3rd Respondent

had stated that he produced the Petitioner before Dr. Mulleriyawa,

Assistant Judicial Medical Officer (AJMO) and after examining the

Petitioner in the absence of the 3rd Respondent, he was directed by the

doctor to take the Petitioner to Colombo National Hospital, which

direction the 3rd Respondent admits he complied with. 3rd Respondent

also admits that the Petitioner was admitted to the hospital.

According to the BHT the complaint of the patient is recorded as

“Fainting attacks”. In his notes, the house officer had recorded, that the

Petitioner claimed that he was assaulted by the Police, initially at Pettah

9

in a Police jeep and later at the Police Station. The Petitioner also had

said that he was assaulted with fists and complained of bodily pains.

The BHT also carries an endorsement, presumably made by the

Petitioner, which reads “I am getting discharged on my own against

medical advice”.

The Petitioner had also produced a Medico Legal Report issued by the

AJMO, Negombo (P9). According to the same the Petitioner had been

admitted to hospital on 01.05.2008 and had been discharged on

02.05.2008. The AJMO had recorded the history given by the patient

as “assaulted by a police officer (I.P. Prassanna Rathnayake) on

28.04.08, again assaulted around 11.00 a.m. with fists and feet. There

were other police officers who assaulted him, in the same manner”.

The AJMO had observed two contusions on the body of the Petitioner

and had recorded that the two injuries as “non-grievous”.

Petitioner had been charged before the Maligakanda Magistrate Court

for possession of 5 cigars made of cannabis. After trial the learned

Magistrate had acquitted the Petitioner on the basis that the prosecution

had failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the Petitioner was

in possession of the cannabis cigars that were produced before the court

as a production.

The 1st Respondent in his statement of objections had admitted that he

was on duty along with the 2nd Respondent at the location where the

alleged incident took place. The 1st Respondent had averred that in

view of the visit to Sri Lanka of the President of Iran, measures were

taken to tighten the security in the city of Colombo and as a security

10

measure all vehicles and persons entering the Gunasinghapura bus

terminal were subjected to search. The 1st Respondent had also stated

that he observed the Petitioner trying to enter the bus terminal avoiding

the stile erected to ensure that all persons who enter the terminal are

checked. The 1st Respondent states that he ran towards the Petitioner

and held him by hand and with difficulty he did a body search of the

Petitioner and recovered five cannabis cigars. The Petitioner had

claimed that he was an army officer and two army personnel who were

also on duty approached the Petitioner and requested him for his

identity card. The Petitioner had abused them and also had stated that

he was senior in rank. The two army officers, Major Sooriyarachchi

and the other officer had then left the scene.

The 1st Respondent claims that he brought the Petitioner to the Dam

Street Police Station in the police vehicle. Whilst categorically denying

that the Petitioner was assaulted, the 1st Respondent states that the

Petitioner was taken to Colombo National Hospital as the Petitioner

complained of a chest pain; and on medical advice, was warded therein.

Major Sooriyarachchi swearing an affidavit (1R2) had supported the

version given by the 1st Respondent in that; he also was on duty at the

Gunasinghapura bus terminus with a junior officer. Major

Sooriyarachchi states in his affidavit that a civilian was conducting

himself in an unruly manner, claiming that he is an Army Officer and

when the Major requested for his Service Identity card, the civilian

concerned abused him in foul language claiming that he is an officer

senior in rank and at that stage he and the junior officer who were on

duty with him left the scene.

11

A member of the Civil Defence Committee Indika Sanjeewa who had

been assisting the police officers of the Dam Street Police Station also

had sworn an affidavit (1R3). He had been on duty at the bus terminus

when this incident took place and had basically affirmed to the facts

referred to by the 1st Respondent, including the recovery of cannabis

cigars.

According to the notes of investigations made by the 1st Respondent

(1R4 (a)), the Petitioner had been stopped and searched when he tried

to avoid the place where people were subjected to search. According to

the notes the Petitioner had tried to break the temporary stile erected to

facilitate the search. The 1st Respondent had made another note

pertaining to the same incident (1R4 (b)) and in these notes the 1st

Respondent had recorded as the Petitioner made an attempt to creep

through the wooden stile.

The 3rd Respondent Sub-Inspector Herath in the objections filed on his

behalf had averred that he has nothing to do with the arrest of the

Petitioner. The position of the 3rd Respondent is that he is a resident of

Kandy and having obtained official leave on 27.04.2008 he travelled to

Kandy and returned on the following day which was 28th. He had

reported for duty only at 20.08 hrs. (8.08 p.m.) on that day. To

substantiate his position he had filed an extract from R.I.B. maintained

by the Dam Street Police Station (3R2). According to the same he had

reported for duty at 8.08 p.m. at the Dam Street Police Station.

The 2nd Respondent in the statement of objections filed on his behalf

had denied that he assaulted the Petitioner. According to the 2nd

Respondent he had been on duty on the day in question and had been

12

engaged in controlling the traffic at a location close to where the 1st

Respondent was also on duty.

As for the arrest of the Petitioner, the 2nd Respondent had affirmed the

position taken up by the 1st Respondent. 2nd Respondent had referred

to the need for a heightened state of security on that day due to the

visit of a head of a state and the fact that the Petitioner had been

questioned by the 1st Respondent when the Petitioner was observed

avoiding going through the security checkpoint.

As referred to earlier, the three medical records – Admission Note (P6),

the Bed Head Ticket and the Medico Legal Report (9) indicate that the

Petitioner had sustained blunt trauma which is compatible with assault.

The Respondent had not denied the fact that they had to admit the

Petitioner to the Colombo National Hospital in the middle of the night,

the reason, however; attributed by the 1st Respondent is that the

Petitioner complained of a chest pain. In the history given by the

Petitioner to the medical officer on admission, it is recorded as he was

assaulted by the police, initially in a Police Jeep and later at the police

Station with their fists.

This appears to be a spontaneous account of events which gives

credence to the Petitioner‟s version. These facts taken together with the

assertions of the Petitioner‟s wife, (P2) his father-in-law (P3) Bhagya

Perera Udawatte, clearly establishes that the Petitioner had been

assaulted by the Police officers.

The main allegation of assault is directed against the 1st Respondent

whom the Petitioner alleges, in addition to abusing him in foul

13

language, assaulted him, initially at Pettah, and later at the Dam Street

Police Station on a number of occasions. The other allegation made by

the Petitioner is that he did not have any narcotics on him at the time of

his arrest and the police foisted the charge on him. The Petitioner had

averred that he is a non-smoker which had been affirmed by both his

wife and the father-in-law.

On the other hand, this incident had been brought about as a result of

the Petitioner confronting the 1st Respondent because of his uncouth

behavior towards his wife. It is highly improbable that a person

carrying narcotics would willingly confront or provoke a police officer

and I am of the view that the charge of possession of cannabis is a

trumped up one. The Petitioner had stated that, soon after he

confronted the 1st Respondent, he brandished a pistol and had told the

Petitioner, he will introduce a hand grenade and produce him before

the Magistrate‟s court.

According to Bhagya Udawatta, when he phoned the O.I.C, Dam Street,

police Station upon hearing that the Petitioner had been brought to the

Dam Street Police Station, the O.IC. told him that the charges were yet

to be framed, which gives credence to the Petitioner‟s version that he

was arrested for no valid reason.

I shall now consider as to whether the facts referred to above had

established any infringed of the fundamental rights of the Petitioner.

This court granted leave to proceed against both the 1st and 3rd

Respondents for the alleged violation of Article 11 of the Constitution.

14

In the case of CHANNA PIERIS AND OTHERS v. ATTORNEY GENERAL

AND OTHERS (1994 1 SLR page 1) Justice Amerasinghe observed

that:-

“In regard to violations of Article 11 (by torture, cruel,

inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment), the

acts or conduct complained of must be qualitatively of a

kind that a Court may take cognizance of. Where it is not

so, the Court will not declare that Article 11 has been

violated. Having regard to the nature and gravity of the

issue, a high degree of certainty is required before the

balance of probability might be said to tilt in favour of a

petitioner endeavouring to discharge his burden of

proving that he was subjected to torture or to cruel,

inhuman or degrading treatment.”

In the case of Jeganathan v. Attorney General and Others 1982 1 SLR

294, the Court held that, where public officers accused of violating the

provisions of Article 11, the allegation must be „strictly proved‟ for if

proved they will carry „serious consequences‟ for such officers.

I have considered the material placed before this Court by both the

Petitioner and on behalf of the Respondents, in the backdrop of the

decisions of this court referred to above. In the face of the cogent and

credible material placed before this Court, I conclude that the Petitioner

had been subjected to torture and degrading treatment.

According to the hospital admission ticket (P6) the doctor who admitted

the Petitioner on the early hours of 29th April,2008 had observed

15

contusions on the posterior of both arms of the Petitioner, which had

been confirmed by the AJMO, Negombo (P9). The history given by the

Petitioner is also consistent in that, he had stated that I.P. Prassanna

Rathnayake assaulted him.

I am of the view that the Petitioner had established to the required

degree of proof that his fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles

11 had been violated and as such I hold that the 1st Respondent

responsible for the infringement of the fundamental right of the

Petitioner guaranteed under Article 11 of the Constitution.

As far as the 3rd Respondent is concerned, he had denied causing any

physical harm to the Petitioner and had taken up the position that he

reported for duty at the Dam Street, police station only around 8.00pm

on the day in question and had produced copies of entries made by him

to that effect. Although the Petitioner had made a general allegation that

the 3rd Respondent also assaulted him, the Petitioner, however, when

examined by AJMO Negombo had only referred to the 1st Respondent by

his name as the person who assaulted him and had made no allegation

against any other officer.

Further, the 3rd Respondent had not been present at the time the

Petitioner was arrested or when he was placed in custody.

Thus, I hold that, as far as the 3rd Respondent is concerned, there is no

material before this court to come to the conclusion that the 3rd

Respondent was responsible for violation of any of the fundamental

rights of the Petitioner guaranteed under the Constitution.

As far as the 2nd Respondent is concerned the violation alleged against

him are under Articles 13 (1) and 13 (2).

16

It appears that the 2nd Respondent had also been on duty in the same

vicinity where the 1st Respondent had been performing duties. In the

statement of objections filed by him, the 2nd Respondent had taken up

the position that it was the 1st Respondent who took action against the

Petitioner and he did not get involved in the investigation pertaining to

this incident. The Petitioner, in his petition has made a reference to the

conduct of the 2nd Respondent and had stated that after the 1st

Respondent dragged him up to the “police cab” the 1st Respondent

assaulted him while three other police officers, including the 2nd

Respondent, held him. From the Petitioners own assertion, it is evident

that the 2nd Respondent‟s involvement is after he was detained by the 1st

Respondent. Thus, there is no material before this court to come to the

conclusion that the 2nd Respondent can be held responsible for the

violation of Petitioner‟s fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 13 (1)

and 13 (2) of the Constitution.

As referred to above, I reject the version of the police that the Petitioner

was arrested for possession of Cannabis and hold that the charge had

merely been foisted upon him to justify the arrest. When one considers

the totality of the facts, the circumstances under which the 1st

Respondent claims that he recovered Cannabis from the possession of

the Petitioner is highly improbable. As such, I reject the version of the

1st Respondent in that regard.

In addition to Article 11 of the Constitution, I also hold that the arrest

and subsequent detention of the Petitioner is not lawful and therefore

the 1st Respondent is also responsible for the violation of Petitioner‟s

fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 13 (1) and 13 (2) of the

Constitution.

17

Over the past 40 years or so, this court, has on innumerable instances

had handed down judgements where it had held that police officers had

acted in excess of authority in scant disregard for the fundamental

rights enshrined in the Constitution. Especially, when dealing with the

public, the police officers have a bounden duty to act with caution and

restrain to ensure that they do nothing in derogation of the

fundamental rights granted to all citizens under the Constitution. The

1st Respondent has failed in the discharge of that duty. The manner in

which the 1st Respondent had acted on this occasion not only tarnishes

the image of the police in the minds of the people, but certainly would

have led to the erosion of the confidence the people have in the police

as the law enforcement arm of the state.

In the instant case, this court cannot condone the Petitioner‟s own

action on this occasion either. He being a former member of a security

force ought to have known that there were security concerns affecting

the country at the relevant time and there was a need to ensure that the

safety of the public is maintained at a location such as the main public

transport terminals in the capital. He does not appear to have rendered

the cooperation expected of a citizen to the law enforcement. The

affidavit of Major Sooriyarachchi amply reflects the boisterous manner

in which the Petitioner was conducting himself on this occasion. It must

also be said, however, that his conduct does not in any way justifies

the conduct of the 1st Respondent and furthermore Article 11 is an

absolute right and as such there is no room for derogation.

For the reasons set out in my judgement, I declare that the 1st

Respondent violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed

by Articles 11, 13 (1) and 13 (2) of the Constitution and that the 2nd

and 3rd Respondents are not guilty of any transgression.

18

1st Respondent is directed to pay the Petitioner a sum of Rs.150, 000/-

(Rupees One hundred and fifty thousand) as compensation and the

State shall pay the Petitioner a sum of Rs.25, 000 as costs.
