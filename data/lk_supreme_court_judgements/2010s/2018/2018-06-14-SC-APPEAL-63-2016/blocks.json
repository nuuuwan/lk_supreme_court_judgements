On 01/12/94 a motion was filed to revoke the proxy which was allowed. (Journal entry No. 5). On 02/09 2009 nearly 16 years after the order directing the Plaintiff to take steps, the Plaintiff filed a fresh proxy and move to issue summons on the 2nd and 3rd Defendants since the 1st Defendant is dead. At this stage the learned District Judge having realized that long period had lapsed after the date given for steps, noticed the parties to decide the question as to whether the action was abated or not. After considering the submissions of parties, the learned District Judge held that the action was not abated. The 2nd and 3rd Defendants appealed against the order and the High Court (Civil Appellate) set aside the order and against that order the Plaintiff- Respondent-Appellant filed a Leave to Appeal application and obtained leave.",
