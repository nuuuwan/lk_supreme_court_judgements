SC. FR. No. 491/2011

The 2nd Respondent, Inspector, Herath Mudiyanselage

Upul Priyalal in his affidavit admits that on 18/01/2011, he was the

Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station of Anamaduwa and that the

official identification Number of the police constable Premarathna is

23078. The 1st Respondent, police constable Premarathna hereinafter

in this order will be referred to as police constable 23078 Premarathna.

The 2nd Respondent in his affidavit admits that the

Petitioner in this case was arrested by a sub inspector attached to his

Police Station. His name was SI Nisansala. However, the 2nd

Respondent further states that the Petitioner was arrested on

18/01/2011. However, the Petitioner states that he was not arrested

on 18/01/2011, but was arrested on 19/01/2011 when he went to the

Police Station on a massage given by PC 23078 Premarathna.

However, the arrest of the Petitioner is admitted by the Officer-in-

Charge of Police Station, IP. Herath Mudiyanselage Upul Priyalal. He

is the 2nd Respondent in this case. The said IP. Herath Mudiyanselage

Upul Priyalal further admits that after the arrest of the Petitioner, the

Petitioner was produced before him and later the Petitioner was

produced before the Magistrate. IP. Upul Priyalal however admits that

he on 31/03/2011 by way of a motion informed the Magistrate that the

Petitioner is not the suspect who was wanted in the said Magistrate’s

Court Case. The case was called on 05/04/2011 and the learned

Magistrate discharged the Petitioner from the said Magistrate’s Court

case.

IP. Upul Priyalal in his affidavit dated 24/09/2012

admits that he informed the Magistrate that the Petitioner (R.H.M.

Keerthirathna) was not the person who was required in the said

SC. FR. No. 491/2011

Magistrate’s Court case. From the affidavit of IP. Upul Priyalal, it is

clear that the Petitioner was arrested on 18/01/2011 and was

produced before the Magistrate and that the Petitioner was on remand

from 19/01/2011 to 05/04/2011. Although the IP. Upul Priyalal states

that the Petitioner was arrested on 18/01/2011, Petitioner says that he

was arrested on 19/01/2011.

From the affidavit of IP. Upul Priyalal, it is clear that

the arrest of the Petitioner is wrong and producing the Petitioner as a

suspect in the Magistrate’s Court is also wrong. The Petitioner admits

that before he was produced before the Magistrate he was in the

custody of the Police. The fact that he was also in the custody of the

Police can be seen from the affidavit of IP. Upul Priyalal.

It is clear from the affidavit of the 2nd Respondent, IP.

Upul Priyalal that the Petitioner was arrested due to mistaken identity.

Considering all these matters, the following matters are

clear;

1. The arrest of the Petitioner by police officers attached to

Anamaduwa Police Station.

2. The fact that the Petitioner was in police custody on 19/01/2011.

3. The fact that the Petitioner was produced before the Magistrate as

a suspect.

4. The fact that the Petitioner has to be on remand on an application

made by the Police.

SC. FR. No. 491/2011

5. The Petitioner was discharged by the learned Magistrate on a

motion filed by the 2nd Respondent.

Although IP. Upul Priyalal takes up the position that it

was SI. Nisansala who arrested the Petitioner, there is no affidavit

given by SI. Nisansala to the above effect.

Considering all these matters, we hold that the

Petitioner has been arrested not on 18/01/2011, but on 19/01/2011

and the said arrest has been made by police constable 23078

Premarathna.

Considering all the above matters, we hold that the

arrest of the Petitioner by the 1st Respondent, police constable 23078

Premarathna is wrong and without any reasons and keeping the

Petitioner in the custody of the Police is also wrong.

The production of the Petitioner as a suspect in the

Magistrate’s Court is also wrong.

From the affidavit of IP. Upul Priyalal, it appears that

he was the Officer-in-Charge of Anamaduwa Police Station on

18/01/2011 and 19/01/2011. There is no dispute on this matter.

It is also clear that after the arrest, the Petitioner was

produced before the said IP. Upul Priyalal who is the 2nd Respondent.

When we consider all the above matters, it is clear that

producing the Petitioner as a suspect in the Magistrate’s Court has

SC. FR. No. 491/2011

6

taken place in the hands of IP. Upul Priyalal.

For the above reasons, we hold that keeping the

Petitioner inside the Police Station and producing him before the

Magistrate’s Court as a suspect are wrong.

Considering all these matters, we hold that the 1st

Respondent (police constable 23078 Premarathna) and Officer-in-

Charge of the Police Station, Anamaduwa IP. Herath Mudiyanselage

Upul Priyalal who is the 2nd Respondent have violated the fundamental

rights of the petitioner guaranteed by Articles 12(1) and 13(1) of the

Constitution.

Considering the facts of this case, we direct the 3rd

Respondent, the Inspector General of Police to conduct an inquiry

about the wrongful arrest of the Petitioner and take necessary legal

steps.

Considering all the above matters, we order the 1st

Respondent, police constable 23078 Premarathna to pay Rs. 25,000/-

to the Petitioner.

We also order the Officer-in-Charge of Police Station,

Anamaduwa, Inspector Herath Mudiyanselage Upul Priyalal who is the

2nd Respondent to pay Rs.50,000/- to the Petitioner. The 1st and the

2nd Respondents have acted in this case as State Officers. Therefore

State is liable to pay compensation to the Petitioner. Considering all

the above matters, we order the State to pay Rs. 500,000/- to the

Petitioner. The said sum of money Rs. 500,000/- should be paid from

funds of the Police Department.

SC. FR. No. 491/2011

We direct the 3rd Respondent to take all necessary

steps to ensure the payment of the said sum within three months from

today. Rs. 25,000/- ordered against the 1st Respondent, police

constable 23078 Premarathna should be paid from his personal funds.

Rs. 50,000/- ordered against the Officer-in-Charge of Police Station,

Anamaduwa, Herath Mudiyanselage Upul Priyalal should be paid from

his personal funds.

We direct the 1st and 2nd Respondents to pay the said

sum of money within 03 months from today.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send certified

copies of this judgment to all the Respondents.
