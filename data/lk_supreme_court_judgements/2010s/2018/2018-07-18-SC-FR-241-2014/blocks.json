Attempts towards religious conversion can become unlawful only if some offence or nuisance, as is recognised by law, is committed in the course of such an exercise. In 2004, a Bill titled \u201cProhibition of Forcible Conversion of Religion Bill\u201d was considered by this Court in the exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction, in SC SD 2/2004 to SC SD 22/2004. In those determinations, this Court found several provisions of that Bill to be violative of several Articles of the Constitution. Consequently, the Bill did not proceed towards enactment. The Legislature has not sought to enact similar legislation after that.",

Most importantly, Baby Nona does not state that, she asked the 3rd respondent to make a complaint of `criminal trespass\u201f against the petitioners. Thus, the 3rd respondent\u201fs claim made in \u201c1R1\u201d that Baby Nona had instructed her to make a complaint, is also shown to be a barefaced lie. A further two documents were annexed to the 1st respondent\u201fs affidavit marked \u201c1R5\u201d and \u201c1R6\u201d but were not referred to in his affidavit. The document marked \u201c1R5\u201d is, on the face of it, an Extract from the Information Book of an Entry made by the 2nd respondent at 2.10pm on 03rd March 2014, which records that the two petitioners had come to the Police Station for the inquiry to be held on that day but that neither complainant - ie: the 3rd respondent [Swaranseeli] or the 4th respondent [Anura] - were present and that the 2nd respondent has sent a message to the complainants to attend the inquiry on 04th March 2014. The document marked \u201c1R6\u201d is, on the face of it, the first page of a Report, dated 14th March 2014, to be made to the Magistrate under Chapter III of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Learned President\u201fs Counsel who appeared for the petitioners has not made an application that these documents be disregarded on the ground that they are not specifically referred to in the petition. In these particular circumstances, I will consider these documents since they assist this Court in determining this application. The 2nd respondent has also tendered an affidavit in which he denies the petitioners\u201f claims and states that he has conducted his duties lawfully. He says he agrees with the statements made in the 1st respondent\u201fs affidavit. He says that he carried out the inquiry on 15th March 2014 because the 1st respondent was on leave on that day. He says that, at this inquiry, \u201chaving heard the parties I took steps to conclude the matter according to the provisions of the law,.\u201d The 2nd respondent annexed Extracts from the Information Book marked \u201c2R1\u201d and \u201c2R2\u201d. The Extract marked \u201c2R1\u201d is a record by the 2nd respondent of the proceedings of the aforesaid inquiry held by him on 15th March 2015. The Extract marked \u201c2R2\u201d contains further statements made by the two complainants [ie: the 3rd and 4th Respondents], on 15th March 2015, at the Kekirawa Police Station.

In any event, I can see no reason why the petitioners would have, on their own free will, wished to come to the Police Station on 01st March 2014. It is very probable that, if not for that compulsion exerted on them by the two police officers, the two petitioners would have, in view of the hostility shown to them, left Kottalbadda and gone back to their homes in Kalakarambewa or gone elsewhere.

If however the impression is conveyed that there is no such option, and the suspect is compelled to come, it is an arrest \u2026.. \u201d. In NAMASIVAYAM vs. GUNAWARDENA, Sharvananda CJ said [at p.401], \u201cin my view, when the 3rd Respondent required the Petitioner to accompany him to the Police Station and took him to the Police Station, the Petitioner was in law arrested by the 3rd Respondent. The Petitioner was prevented by the action of the 3rd Respondent from proceeding with his journey in the bus. The Petitioner was deprived of his liberty to go where he pleased. It was not necessary that there should have been any actual use of force; threat of force used to procure the Petitioner\u201fs submission was sufficient. The Petitioner did not go to the Police Station voluntarily. He was taken to the Police by the 3rd Respondent.\u201d. As Fernando J succinctly put it in SIRISENA vs. PERERA [1991 2 SLR 97 at p.107] \u201c Whether or not a person has been arrested depends not on the legality of the arrest but on whether he has been deprived of his liberty to go where he pleases.\u201d.",

It is reasonable to infer that, when, on 01st March 2014, the residents of Kottalbadda informed the Kekirawa Police Station about the presence of the petitioners in the village, the two police officers proceeded to Chandima\u201fs house upon orders given by the 1st respondent, possibly in terms of section 109 (5) (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, as amended. In any event, it can be assumed that, upon their return to the Police Station the two police officers reported the fact of the arrest to the 1st respondent, inter alia, in terms of section 109 (4) or section 109 (4A) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Thereupon, the 1st respondent has, himself, interviewed the petitioners at the Police Station, presumably acting, inter alia, in terms of section 109 (5) (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Soon thereafter, the petitioners have been taken into custody and detained. Thereby, the 1st respondent has also ratified the earlier arrest of the petitioners by the two police officers. In any event, the 1st respondent has not suggested that these police officers were acting without his directions or outside of authority given to them by him. These circumstances establish that the two police officers acted under the directions of or with the authority of the 1st respondent, when they arrested the petitioners and brought them to the Police Station.",

In CHANNA PIERIS vs. ATTORNEY GENERAL, Amerasinghe J carried out a learned and exhaustive analysis of the judgments which have considered this issue. It will suffice, for the purposes of the present judgment, to cite His Lordship\u201fs following exposition [at p.45-47] which draws on the previous decisions and sets out the applicable principles: \u201cThe provisions relating to arrest are materially different to those applying to the determination of the guilt or innocence of the arrested person. One is at or near the starting point of criminal proceedings while the other constitutes the termination of those proceedings and is made by the Judge after the hearing of submissions from all parties. The power of arrest does not depend on the requirement that there must be clear and sufficient proof of the commission of the offence alleged. What the officer making the arrest needs to have are reasonable grounds for suspecting the persons to be concerned in or to be committing or to have committed the offence. \u2026.. A reasonable suspicion may be based either upon matters within the officer's knowledge or upon credible information furnished to him, or upon a combination of both sources. He may inform himself either by personal investigation or by adopting information supplied to him or by doing both \u2026. A suspicion does not become \"reasonable\" merely because the source of the information is creditworthy. If he is activated by an unreliable informant, the officer making the arrest should, as a matter of prudence, act with greater circumspection than if the information had come from a creditworthy source. However, eventually the question is whether in the circumstances, including the reliability of the sources of information, the person making the arrest could, as a reasonable man, have suspected that the persons were concerned in or committing or had committed the offence in question \u2026\u2026 However the officer making an arrest cannot act on a suspicion founded on mere conjecture or vague surmise. His information must give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the suspect was concerned in the commission of an offence for which he could have arrested a person without a warrant. The suspicion must not be of an uncertain and vague",

In this regard, the offence of `criminal trespass\u201f is defined in section 427 of the Penal Code which states: \u201cWhoever enters into or upon property in the occupation of another with intent to commit an offence, or to intimidate, insult, or annoy any person in occupation of such property, or having lawfully entered upon such property unlawfully remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such person, or with intent to commit an offence, is said to commit `criminal trespass\u201f\u201d. It follows that, since the 1st respondent should have, in the words of Amerasinghe J, had \u201creasonable grounds for suspecting\u201d that the petitioners had committed the offence of `criminal offence\u201f before he could lawfully proceed with the arrest and take the petitioners into custody, there should have been sufficient material before him to enable him to form a reasonable suspicion that the two petitioners had been concerned with the commission of an offence of `criminal trespass\u201f, as described in section 427 of the Penal Code. Further, when I proceed to determine whether the 1st respondent did have \u201creasonable grounds for suspecting\u201d that the petitioners had committed the offence of `criminal trespass\u201f, I am required, as set out above, to apply an objective test. The subjective state of mind of the 1st respondent is not the determining factor. Instead, the determining factor is whether, when objectively regarded, there was sufficient material for the 1st respondent to reasonably suspect that the petitioners had been concerned with the offence of `criminal trespass\u201f. In this regard, as observed earlier, the only material furnished to this Court by the 1st respondent, as being the material before him when he decided to proceed with the arrest and take the petitioners into custody, is the aforesaid statement made by the 3rd respondent and recorded in \u201c1R1\u201d.",

    "text": "But, that position is false because, as set out above, the factual position was that the two petitioners were brought to the Kekirawa Police Station by the two police officers who had come to Chandima\u201fs house and compelled the petitioners to proceed to the Police Station. It seems to me that, this false record in \u201c1R1\u201d assumes significance because it impugns the bona fides of the 1st respondent\u201fs actions. That is because, it stands to reason that, if the 1st respondent had acted bona fide, he would have ensured that the fact that two police officers brought the petitioners to the Police Station, be recorded in \u201c1R1\u201d. Further, if the 1st respondent had acted bona fide, he would have ensured that, at the same time the Entry \u201c1R1\u201d was recorded, the information given by those two police officers, who had first-hand and personal knowledge of the events which led to the 3rd respondent\u201fs complaint, was also recorded in the Information Book, inter alia, in terms of the provisions of section 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Common sense dictates that, if the 1st respondent was to act bona fide, he would have decided whether or not he should proceed with the arrest and take the petitioners into custody, only after considering such information given by the two police officers vis-\u00e0-vis the 3rd respondent\u201fs complaint and its merits. In this regard, as set out earlier, our law requires a police officer to act reasonably when deciding whether or not he should arrest a suspected offender under the provisions of section 32 (1) (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Further, as set out above, section 32 (1) (b) allows an arrest of a person based on a complaint made against him, only if that complaint is a \u201creasonable complaint\u201d. It seems to me that, a consequence of this requirement is that, where a police officer is considering making an arrest and taking a person into custody solely based on an complaint received by him from a member of the public without that police officer having any first-hand knowledge of the facts relating to the alleged offence and the circumstances are such that the police officer has a readily available and prima facie reliable source from which he can quickly and conveniently obtain information which will enable him to assess whether that complaint is a \u201creasonable complaint\u201d as envisaged in section 32 (1) (b), he should, where practically possible and, particularly, where there is no likelihood of the suspected offender `escaping\u201f before such information can be obtained, obtain that information before deciding whether there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to arrest the suspected offender and take him into custody based on that complaint made by a member of the public. In taking this view I am also guided by Scott LJ\u201fs observations in DUMBELL VS. ROBERTS [1944 1 AER 326] - a decision which has been referred to, with approval, by this Court on several occasions - vide: for instance, MUTTUSAMY vs. KANNANGARA [at p.330], CHANNA PIERIS vs. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL [at p.51] and FAIZ VS. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL [1995 1 SLR 372 at p.399]. Scott LJ said [at p.329] \u201cThe duty of the police when they arrest without warrant is, no doubt, to be quick to see the possibility of crime, but equally they ought to be anxious to avoid mistaking the innocent for the guilty. The British principle of personal freedom, that every man should be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty,",

    "text": "applies also to the police function of arrest - in a very modified degree, it is true, but at least to the extent of requiring them to be observant, receptive and open-minded and to notice any relevant circumstance which points either way, either to innocence or to guilt. They may have to act on the spur of the moment and have no time to reflect and be bound, therefore, to arrest to prevent escape; but where there is no danger of the person who ex-hypothesi aroused their suspicion, that he is probably an \u201eoffender\u201f attempting to escape, they should make all presently practicable enquiries from persons present or immediately accessible who are likely to be able to answer their enquiries forthwith. I am not suggesting a duty on the police to try to prove innocence; that is not their function; but they should act on the assumption that their prima facie suspicion may be ill-founded. That duty attaches particularly where slight delay does not matter because there is no probability, in the circumstances of the arrest or intended arrest, of the suspected person running away. The duty attaches, I think, simply because of the double-sided interest of the public in the liberty of the individual as well as in the detection of crime.\u201d. Applying this approach, I am of the view that, there was a duty cast on the 1st respondent to have first asked the two police officers as to what they personally saw and heard and what led them to bring the two petitioners to the Police Station and then, based on such information, assess whether the 3rd respondent had made a \u201creasonable complaint\u201d that the petitioners had been concerned in the offence of `criminal trespass\u201f. The 1st respondent, who was required by the Law to act reasonably, should have decided whether or not he should proceed with the arrest and take the petitioners into custody and detain them, only after considering such information given by the two police officers vis-\u00e0-vis the 3rd respondent\u201fs complaint and its merits. In this regard, it is to be kept in mind that, the two police officers would have been close at hand or readily contactable and there was no risk of the petitioners going anywhere before these simple and quick steps were taken. In these circumstances, the 1st respondent\u201fs failure to take the steps referred to earlier, leads to the inference that, he did not act reasonably when he decided to proceed with the arrest and take the petitioners into custody, based solely on the complaint made by the 3rd respondent [Swarnaseeli]. Further, as mentioned earlier, the false record made in \u201c1R1\u201d that the petitioners were brought to the Police Station by the 3rd respondent and the deliberate omission of the fact that two police officers brought the petitioners to the Police Station, impugns the 1st respondent\u201fs bona fides. All this gives a measure of credibility to the petitioners\u201f charge that the 3rd and 4th respondents \u201c\u2026.. made a complaint against the Petitioners, under the directions of the officers of the Kekirawa Police Station, and have acted in collusion with such officers.\u201d. However, I consider it necessary to examine the circumstances further and ascertain whether, in any event, there was sufficient material before the 1st respondent to enable him to have \u201creasonable grounds for suspecting\u201d that the petitioners had committed the offence of `criminal trespass\u201f.",

    "text": "It is evident from the definition of `criminal trespass\u201f in section 427 of the Penal Code which was cited earlier, that one of the essential constituent elements of the offence of \u201ecriminal trespass\u201f is that, the offender must have unlawfully entered or remained on a property which is in the occupation of another person and also have done so with the intent to commit an offence or with the intent to intimidate, insult or annoy a person who was in occupation of that property. It is long and well established Law that, as section 427 makes plainly clear, the offence of `criminal trespass\u201f is committed against a person who is in \u201coccupation of such property\u201d [or his agent who is on the property representing him] and not against a mere bystander or visitor who happens to be on that property at the time of the commission of the alleged offence. Thus, in ROWTHER vs. MOHIDEEN [1914 1 Bal. Notes 1 at p. 2] Wood Renton J made it clear that, the offence of `criminal trespass\u201f as defined in section 427 of the Penal Code, is \u201c\u2026.. confined I think to a trespass committed against the person in apparent occupation of premises \u2026..\u201d. On similar lines, in NALLAN CHETTY vs. MUSTAFA [19 NLR 262 at p.263], De Sampayo J observed, \u201c\u2026.. it is necessary that the property should be in the `occupation\u201f of a person \u2026. the offence of criminal trespass is one that affects not so much the property which is entered upon as the person who is in occupation.\u201d. In KING vs. SELVANAYAGAM [51 NLR 470 at p.474], the Privy Council referred to section 427 of the Penal Code and observed \u201cIt is to be noted that the section deals with occupation, which is a matter of fact , .\u2026. there must be an occupier whose occupation is interfered with, and whom it is intended to insult, intimidate or annoy (unless the intent is to commit an offence).\u201d. and [at p.475] \u201cTo establish criminal trespass the prosecution must prove that the real or dominant intent of the entry was to commit an offence or to insult, intimidate or annoy the occupant\u2026..\u201d In ANNAPAN vs. MURRAY [75 NLR 342 at p.344]. Alles J, referring to section 427 of the Penal Code, said, \u201c\u2026.. the prosecution must prove that the real or dominant intention of the entry was to commit an offence or to insult, intimidate or annoy the occupant.\u201d. Therefore, in the present case, the petitioners could have committed the alleged offence of `criminal trespass\u201f only against the occupant of the property they are said to have entered into or remained on. In the present case, the 3rd respondent\u201fs complaint recorded in \u201c1R1\u201d and set out earlier in this judgment, specifically states that, the Baby Nona was the occupant of the property which the petitioners are said to have entered into or remained upon and that Baby Nona has asked the 3rd respondent to make a complaint against the petitioners. The 3rd respondent has made it very clear that she was, at best, only a visitor who happened to be at that property at the material time. Therefore, prima facie, the petitioners could have committed the offence of `criminal trespass\u201f only against Baby Nona. The petitioners could not have committed that offence against the 3rd respondent.",

    "text": "These facts were staring the 1st respondent in his face and he was very well aware that the complainant [the 3rd respondent] was not the \u201coccupier\u201d of the property in question and that the alleged offence of `criminal trespass\u201f could not have been committed against her. In this connection, as mentioned earlier, I have held that, the Entry in \u201c1R1\u201d was made with the full knowledge of the 1st respondent and on his directions. The 1st respondent would have had full knowledge of what the 3rd respondent said and what was recorded in \u201c1R1\u201d. It is to be also seen that, although the 3rd respondent said that Baby Nona had asked her to make a complaint against the petitioners, the other complainant - ie: the 4th respondent [Anura] \u2013 did not state in \u201c1R2\u201d that, Baby Nona was present at the time of the alleged incident or that she made any complaint against the petitioners. Thus, the only material before the 1st respondent which suggested that the petitioners had committed an offence of criminal trespass, was the verbal claim made by the 3rd respondent that the \u201coccupier\u201d of the property - ie: Baby Nona - had asked the 3rd respondent to make a complaint against the petitioners. While I do not suggest that, the 1st respondent was required to carry out a lawyerly analysis of the elements of the offence of `criminal trespass\u201f prior to arresting the petitioners, he was, nevertheless, required by Law, to have \u201creasonable grounds for suspecting\u201d that the petitioners had been concerned with the commission of an offence of `criminal trespass\u201f, as described in section 427 of the Penal Code, prior to deciding to proceed with the arrest of the petitioners and take them into custody. At the minimum, this required him to first satisfy himself that, there were reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence of `criminal trespass\u201f had been committed against the \u201coccupier\u201d of the property in question. In these circumstances, the 1st respondent, who was required to act reasonably\u201f, was under a duty to take the elementary step of ascertaining the facts from the \u201coccupier\u201d of the property in question [ie: Baby Nona] and verifying from Baby Nona that she wished to make a complaint of `criminal trespass\u201f against the petitioners. He was obliged to take these steps before he decided whether or not he should proceed with the arrest and take the petitioners into custody on suspicion of an offence of criminal trespass. He could not have \u201creasonable grounds for suspecting\u201d that the petitioners had committed the offence of `criminal trespass\u201f unless and until he obtained that information. He was not lawfully entitled to have acted on the mere verbal claim made by the 3rd respondent that Baby Nona had asked her to make a complaint. For all he knew, the 3rd respondent could have been making a false and malicious complaint, either for her own reasons or on the instigation of another. Equally possibly, the 3rd respondent might have been merely an interfering busybody who had no knowledge of what happened. In fact, subsequent events strongly point to one of those conclusions. In this connection, it has to be kept in mind that, Baby Nona lived in Kottalbadda, which is close to the Kekirawa Police Station. Therefore, the 1st respondent would have had no difficulty in checking with Baby Nona first.",

    "text": "Further, there was no risk of the petitioners going anywhere before this simple and quick step was taken. I am of the view that, the 1st respondent\u201fs failure to ascertain the facts from the \u201coccupier\u201d of the property in question - ie: Baby Nona - and his failure to ascertain from her whether she wished to complain that the petitioners had committed the offence of `criminal trespass\u201f against her, establish that, the 1st respondent did not have \u201creasonable grounds for suspecting\u201d that the petitioners had been concerned with an offence of `criminal trespass\u201f at the time he decided to proceed with the arrest and take the petitioners into custody. The validity of the above conclusion is reinforced when one reads the statement made by Baby Nona and recorded in \u201c1R3\u201d. Baby Nona\u201fs statement was obtained when the 1st respondent eventually realized that he had been under a duty to obtain a statement from her - ie: from the occupier of the property insofar as section 427 of the Penal Code is concerned. That had led to Police Constable 35316, Bandara being despatched to Baby Nona\u201fs house in Kottalbadda to record her statement. Bandara has recorded her statement at 5.00pm on 01st March 2014 - ie: several hours after the petitioners had been arrested and placed in custody. The relevant contents of Baby Nona\u201fs statement have been set out earlier in this judgment. As set out earlier, Baby Nona\u201fs statement exposes, as an utter falsehood, the 3rd respondent\u201fs claim that she and Baby Nona were talking with each other from 10.30am on 01st March 2014 when the petitioners came to Baby Nona\u201fs house at about 10.45am. Most importantly, Baby Nona does not state that she asked the 3rd respondent to make a complaint of `criminal trespass\u201f against the petitioners and establishes that, the 3rd respondent\u201fs claim made in \u201c1R1\u201d that Baby Nona had instructed her to make a complaint, was a barefaced lie. This fact highlights the importance of the 1st respondent\u201fs duty to have checked with the occupant of the property - ie: Baby Nona - before he proceeded with the arrest of the petitioners and took them into custody. For the reasons I have set out above, I hold that, there were no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the petitioners had committed the offence of `criminal trespass\u201f at the time the petitioners were first arrested at Chandima\u201fs premises and brought to the Police Station where the 1st respondent decided to proceed with the arrest and take the petitioners into custody. As observed earlier, this was all part of the sequence of events in which the petitioners were arrested on 01st March 2014.",

It seems to me that, the Kekirawa Police had intended to deter the petitioners from carrying out any further visits of this nature to the area and that, on 01st March 2014, the petitioners were unnecessarily, unreasonably and unlawfully arrested on unsustainable charges and, thereafter, detained overnight, in order to give effect to that intention. The police officers were probably motivated by a desire to prevent disharmony in their community and, even perhaps, a desire to protect their own religion from what they saw as incursions of another faith. Those motives are human traits and are understandable. However, police officers must act lawfully and also act respectfully of the rights of all persons in the country including persons who profess different beliefs or who are different in some other way, even where those different beliefs or ways are distasteful to the police officers.

As Sharvananda CJ tellingly said in JOSEPH PERERA vs. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL [at p. 225], \u201cOne of the basic values of a free society to which we are pledged under our Constitution is founded on the conviction that there must be freedom not only for the thought we cherish, but also for the thought we hate.\u201d. It has also been established that, the petitioners were unnecessarily, unreasonably and unlawfully detained overnight on 01st March 2014 despite the fact that, they could have been released in the evening of that day as soon as it became known that the occupier of the property in question [ie: Baby Nona] has not made a complaint of `criminal trespass\u201f against the petitioners and, further, when it came to light that, the 3rd respondent\u201fs complaint was utterly false. Further, in the circumstances of this case, the petitioners\u201f statement that they were berated, humiliated and threatened at the Kekirawa Police Station, first by the 1st respondent in the evening of 01st March 2014 and, thereafter, throughout that night by other police officers, rings true and I am inclined to believe it. It should also be noted that, although the petitioners were detained overnight, they were never produced before a Magistrate and, further, as mentioned earlier, the Report marked \u201c1R6\u201d said to have been submitted to the Magistrate by the Kekirawa Police, was falsified. The aforesaid facts establish that the 1st respondent and officers acting under his directions and with his authority have acted in a manner which is manifestly unreasonable, arbitrary and unlawful. It is very apparent that, the aforesaid acts and omissions of the 1st respondent and officers acting under his directions and with his authority, were intentionally done and were deliberate. They were not inadvertent mistakes. In these circumstances, I am of the view that, the aforesaid acts and omissions of the 1st respondent have denied the petitioners their fundamental right, guaranteed by Article 12(1), to the equal protection of the Law. Accordingly, I hold that the 1st respondent has also violated the petitioners\u201f fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1). The 1st respondent and his men would have done well to keep in mind the teaching of the Lord Buddha who counselled that, teachers of other doctrines and their followers, should be treated with respect. The Enlightened One taught in the Brahmajala Sutta, which is very first Sutta in the Sutta Pitaka [Digha Nikaya 1.1.5], \u201cMonks, if anyone should speak in disparagement of me, of the Dhamma or of the Sangha, you should not be angry, resentful or upset on that account. If you were to be angry or displeased at such disparagement, that would only be a hindrance to you. For if others disparage me, the Dhamma or the Sangha, and you are angry and displeased, can you recognise whether what they say is right or not ? `No Lord\u201f. If others disparage me, the Dhamma or the Sangha, then you must explain what is incorrect as being incorrect, saying `that is incorrect, that is false, that is not our way, that is not found among us.\u201d.

In the Upali Sutta [Majjhima Nikaya 56.17], when the householder Upali, who till then had been a follower of Nigantha Natapuththa, entered into a discourse with the Buddha and became the Buddha\u201fs lay follower, the Buddha counselled Upali: \u201cHouseholder, your family has long supported the Niganthas and you should consider that alms should be given to them when they come.\u201d. [Translation of the Majjhima Nikaya by M. Walshe]. In his Rock Edict XII, which stands to this day on Mount Girnar in Jungadh, Gujarat, the great Emperor Dharmashoka, exhorted his people, saying: \u201cBeloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, honors both ascetics and the householders of all religions, and he honors them with gifts and honors of various kinds. But Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, does not value gifts and honors as much as he values this - that there should be growth in the essentials of all religions. Growth in essentials can be done in different ways, but all of them have as their root restraint in speech, that is, not praising one's own religion, or condemning the religion of others without good cause. And if there is cause for criticism, it should be done in a mild way. But it is better to honor other religions for this reason. By so doing, one's own religion benefits, and so do other religions, while doing otherwise harms one's own religion and the religions of others. Whoever praises his own religion, due to excessive devotion, and condemns others with the thought \"Let me glorify my own religion,\" only harms his own religion. Therefore contact (between religions) is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others. Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, desires that all should be well-learned in the good doctrines of other religions.\u201d.

    "text": "Accordingly, this Court is required to carefully examine the material before us and determine whether, there has been, in fact, a violation of the petitioners\u201f fundamental rights which are guaranteed by Article 14(1)(e). That examination should be done objectively and dispassionately, if one is to seek to ensure the Rule of Law. Particularly so, when a Court examines issues, such as the one before us, which some may consider to be emotive. What Article 14(1)(e) confers is the freedom to manifest one\u201fs \u201creligion\u201d or \u201cbelief\u201d in \u201cworship, observance, practice and teaching;\u201d and to do so either alone or with others and in public or in private. The word religion has its root in the Latin word religio which Cicero once described as meaning \u201ccultum deorum\u201d - which could be said to translate to mean `piously worshipping the gods\u201f [Cicero\u201fs Deo Natura Deorum - Book 1 at sections 116-117]. The word \u201creligion\u201d is hard to define. It can mean different things to different people and, as a result, there has been much interesting philosophical, philological and etymological debate among scholars, on what the word means. However, it is unnecessary, for the purposes of this judgment, to venture into those issues since it is evident that the word \u201creligion\u201d is used in Article 14(1)(e) in its modern day context of meaning a particular system of beliefs - either belief in an essentially non-theistic doctrine and its aligned code of living which achieves one\u201fs spiritual, mental and material development [including agnostic or atheistic beliefs] or a theistic belief in a",

It is evident that, the word \u201cbelief\u201d is used in the same context in Article 14(1)(e) and that there is little to be gleaned from seeking to ascertain whether it has a significantly different meaning to the word \u201creligion\u201d with specific reference to its use in Article 14(1)(e). In fact, the definitions of the word \u201cbelief\u201d in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary [5th ed.] include \u201cfaith\u201d and \u201cTrust in God; religious faith; acceptance of any received theology\u201d and also \u201ca religion\u201d. Next, there can be no doubt that, the petitioners\u201f religion of Christianity is a \u201creligion\u201d within the meaning of Article 14(1)(e) and that, therefore, the petitioners are entitled to the full compass of their rights under Article 14(1)(e) to manifest their \u201creligion \u2026. in worship, observance, practice and teaching;\u201d and to do so either alone or with others and in public or in private. The fact that, the petitioners are members of the \u201cJehovah\u201fs Witnesses\u201d, which may appear to some to be a somewhat singular denomination within the Christian faith, and are not members of a mainstream Christian Church - whether Catholic and Protestant, makes no difference to the petitioners\u201f right to the freedom granted by Article 14(1)(e). The fact that the tenets of the denomination differ, in some significant aspects, from the doctrines of the mainstream Christian Churches, makes no difference. Thus, what remains to be examined is whether the events of 01st March 2014 violated the petitioners\u201f freedom to manifest their religion \u201cin worship, observance, practice and teaching;\u201d and to do so either alone or with others and in public or in private. It has to be remembered that, the burden of proving such a violation is placed on the petitioners. In this regard, the petitioners say that, on 01st March 2014, they set off for Kottalbadda to visit Niluka Maduwanthi who had invited them to visit her house. The petitioners have not annexed an affidavit from Niluka Maduwanthi in proof of this invitation. The petitioners have also not furnished any explanation for not producing such an affidavit. In the absence of such corroboration, I am not inclined to place much credence on the petitioners\u201f claim that they were bound only for Niluka Maduwanthi\u201fs house when the events relating to this application took place. It should be said here, in the interest of clarity, that this finding does not take away from the validity of the petitioners\u201f complaints with regard to their unlawful arrest and detention. Instead, I am of the view that, in the totality of the circumstances of this case, it is much more probable that, the petitioners set off for Kottalbadda on 01st March 2014, as part of a public ministry in the course of which their objective was to carry out house-to-house visits seeking to spread their faith among members of the public. I reach that conclusion for the two reasons, which I have set out below. Firstly, as I understand it, Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses see the Bible as the inerrant word of God as propounded by the Christian faith and consider what is written in the Bible, as historically accurate to the last word and detail. Accordingly, they believe that",

    "text": "Jesus Christ \u201c\u2026.. went through every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God:\u201d [Luke 8:1] and that Jesus Christ exhorted his disciples to \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature\u201d [Mark 16:15]. Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses also believe that, Jesus\u201f disciples honoured those instructions and that the disciples \u201c\u2026.. daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.\u201d. [Acts 5:42]. [All the citations are from the King James Version of the Bible]. Those beliefs are often regarded as being part of the Christian faith and are to be respected by all right thinking persons. However, what is important for the purposes of the present case is that, Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses believe that each of them have a duty to follow in those footsteps of Jesus and his disciples and \u201cteach and preach\u201d the gospel of their denomination in public and \u201cand in every house\u201d, whenever possible. They believe that, doing so includes public ministries in the course of which they carry out house-to-house visits seeking to spread their faith and also distribute their publications such as \u201cThe Watchtower\u201d and \u201cAwake\u201d which set out the teachings of the denomination. Individual Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses have a duty to carry out house-house visits. Such visits are usually carried out by two or more Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses. Although it hardly needs to be said here, let me hasten to add, in the interests of clarity, that such public ministries would, ordinarily, be lawful. A contravention of the Law may arise only if some offence or nuisance, as is recognised by Law, is committed in the course of such an exercise. Secondly, in their petition, the petitioners say that, the events which led to their arrest and detention on 01st March 2014 commenced when they were engaged in a discussion with Chandima seated on chairs at the entrance to her house and \u201cDuring the discussion, an unidentified man, from a near-by house, approached the Petitioners and demanded to know what they were doing, and in fact took the religious literature that was in the woman\u201fs hand and walked off\u201d. I can think of no reason why that man would have behaved in such an unusual manner, unless he had seen the petitioners in Kottalbadda on an earlier occasion when they were on a public ministry and had decided to interrupt a repetition of such an exercise if the petitioners came to Kottalbadda on another day. It seems to me that, unless that man had seen the petitioners engage in a public ministry earlier, he would have had no cause to react in that manner to the passing sight of two ladies, seated down and having an amicable chat with a neighbor. This conclusion is strengthened by the 4th respondent\u201fs [Anura] statement in \u201c1R2\u201d saying that the petitioners had come to Kottalbadda on an earlier occasion and sought to spread their faith among the residents of that village \u2013 \u201c\u0d92 \u0db8\u0dda\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dda \u0db8\u0dd3\u0da7 \u0db8\u0db3\u0dbb \u0daf\u0dc0\u0dc3 \u0d86\u0dd9\u0dd9\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dca\u0db6\u0db1\u0dca\u0db0\u0db8\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca \u0db8\u0daf\u0dca\u0dc1\u0db1 \u0daf\u0dd3\u0db4\u0dd4 \u0da7\u0dca\u0da7\u0dd2\u0dba \u0db6\u0dc0 \u0dd9\u0dd9 \u0dc4\u0db3\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dcf \u0dd9\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad\u0dcf. \u0db8\u0db8\u0dca \u0d85\u0dba \u0db3\u0dad\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dd2 \u0dcf \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d85\u0db4\u0dd2\u0da7 \u0daf\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dcf, \u0d91\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0db8\u0dda \u0d86\u0dd9\u0dd9\u0da7 \u0db6\u0dd0\u0db8\u0daf\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1 \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd\u0dcf. \u0d85\u0db8\u0db4\u0dca \u0dd9\u0db8\u0db8\u0dca \u0d85\u0dba \u0daf\u0dd0\u0db1\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca \u0dbb\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0dad\u0dd2\u0db6\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dda, \u0db8\u0db8\u0dca \u0d85\u0dba \u0db1\u0dd0\u0dc0\u0dad \u0d85\u0db8\u0dc0\u0ddc\u0dad\u0dca \u0db8\u0db3\u0ddc\u0dbd\u0dd3\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dba\u0da7 \u0d85\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0db8\u0daf\u0db8\u0dd4 \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd\u0dcf.\u201d.

It then follows that, the petitioners were engaged in a discussion with Chandima at her house, in the course of one such house-to house visit. It is clear that, the petitioners\u201f complaint that their freedom guaranteed by Article 14(1)(e) was violated, flows from the undisputed fact that they were prevented from continuing with their discussion with Chandima when they were bundled off to the Police Station by the two police officers who had come to Chandima\u201fs house. Accordingly, what has to be now decided is whether the acts of the 1st respondent and police officers acting under his directions and with his authority, which prevented the petitioners from continuing their discussion with Chandima, violated the petitioners\u201f freedom, which is guaranteed by Article 14(1)(e), to manifest their religion \u201cin worship, observance, practice and teaching;\u201d. This requires me to first seek to ascertain what, on a standard of probability, was likely to have transpired during that discussion. In that regard, the petitioners state, in their petition, only that they \u201ediscussed the Bible\u201d with Chandima. In contrast, the 3rd respondent\u201fs statement in \u201c1R1\u201d say that the petitioners tried to convert her to the petitioners\u201f faith and Baby Nona\u201fs statement in \u201c1R3\u201d also says that the petitioners tried to convert her to the petitioners\u201f faith and that the petitioners spoke of Armageddon and the salvation of only those who were adherents of their faith.

These publications and the website, read together, make clear the nature and character of the house-to-house visits made by Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses. It is seen that, members of the denomination are expected to go from house-to-house in an effort to meet people and engage in discussions with whoever is willing to listen. It is also seen that, the members of Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses who are on such exercises, carry copies of their publications which they hand out. It is evident that, members of the denomination who are engaged in such house-to-house visits are expected to follow a somewhat structured script which helps to guide the conversation to the areas they wish to discuss. These areas for discussion, include: a description of their faith and its theology coupled with references to appropriate passages from the Bible which are set out in the publications; an extolling of the faith held by Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses as the sole truth and only redemption; and, though couched in subtle language, an unmistakably clear message that the only hope of a person escaping damnation and eternal suffering is",

If the answer is that the discussion did fall within that phrase, the prevention of the discussion by the 1st and 2nd respondents and the officers under their command, would constitute a violation of the petitioners\u201f freedom guaranteed by Article 14(1)(e). In contrast, if the discussion does not properly fall within the phrase \u201cworship, observance, practice and teaching;\u201d used in Article 14(1)(e), the prevention of the discussion would not have violated Article 14(1)(e). The meaning of the words \u201cworship\u201d and \u201cobservance\u201d in relation to a religion or set of beliefs, are well known. For purposes of completeness, the Shorter Oxford Dictionary [5th ed.] defines \u201cworship\u201d as meaning \u201cHonour or adore as divine or sacred, esp. with religious rites or ceremonies; offer prayer or prayers to (a god)\u201d and defines \u201cobservance\u201d as meaning \u201can act performed in accordance with prescribed usage, esp. one of religious or ceremonial character; a customary rite or ceremony.\u201d. It is obvious that, the discussion the petitioners were having with Chandima could not have been the manifesting of an act of \u201cworship\u201d or \u201cobservance\u201d of the petitioners\u201f religion, within the meaning of Article 14(1)(e) of the Constitution. As for the word \u201cpractice\u201d which features in Article 14(1)(e), the Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines the word as meaning \u201cThe habitual doing or carrying out of something; usual or customary action or performance\u201d. I am inclined to consider that, the fact that the word \u201cpractice\u201d is placed in Article 14(1)(e) together with and following from the words \u201cworship\u201d and \u201cobservance\u201d, suggests that, the word \u201cpractice\u201d is used in Article 14(1)(e) to mean and refer to a customary or traditional ritual, ceremony or act which is performed in the course of or allied to or consequent to acts of \u201cworship\u201d and \u201cobservance\u201d of a religion or a set of beliefs. This conclusion is warranted by the maxim noscitur a sociis which postulates that, in matters of statutory interpretation, the coupling of words which have analogous meanings suggests that they should be understood to be used in their cognate sense and that",

As a result, I am of the view that, the word \u201cpractice\u201d is used in Article 14(1)(e) to mean and refer to a customary or traditional ritual, ceremony or act which is performed in the course of or allied to or consequent to acts of \u201cworship\u201d and \u201cobservance\u201d of a religion or a set of beliefs. Consequently, the discussion the petitioners were having with Chandima in the course of a programme of house-to-house visits, could not have been the manifesting of a \u201cpractice\u201d of the petitioners\u201f religion, within the meaning of Article 14(1)(e) of the Constitution. In reaching this conclusion, I am fortified by the views expressed by the Supreme Court of India in THE COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS vs. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SWAMIAR OF SRI SHIRUR MUTT [1954 AIR SC 282]. In that case, Mukherjea J [as he then was] said, \u201cIf the tenets of any religious sect of the Hindus prescribe that offerings of food should be given to the idol at particular hours of the day, that periodical ceremonies should be performed in a certain way at certain periods of the year or that there should be daily recital of sacred texts or ablations to the sacred fire, all these would be regarded as parts of religion and the mere fact that they involve expenditure of money or employment of priests and servants or the use of marketable commodities would not make them secular activities partaking of a commercial or economic character; all of them are religious practices and should be regarded as matters of religion \u2026\u2026\u201d [emphasis added by me]. In RATILAL PANACHAND GANDHI vs. STATE OF BOMBAY [AIR 1954 388 at p.392] Mukherjea J, referring to rites and ceremonies performed at specified times and in a particular manner by adherents of the Jain religion and Parsi religion, stated \u201cReligious practices or performances of acts, in pursuance of religious belief are as much a part of religion as faith or belief in particular doctrines.\u201d. In SARDAR SYEDNA TAHER SAIFUDDIN SAHEB vs. STATE OF BOMBAY [1962 SC 853] Sinha CJ referred to practices such a sacrifices, Sati immolations and the dedication of very young girls as devadasis, as being \u201creligious practices\u201d which had been restrained by law. The learned Chief Justice commented [at p. 864] \u201cWe have therefore, to draw a line of demarcation between practices consisting of rites and ceremonies connected with the particular kind of worship, which is the tenet of the religious community, and practices in other matters which may touch the religious institutions at several points, but which are not intimately concerned with rites and ceremonies the performance of which is an essential part of the religion. Then, in ACHARYA JAGDISHWARANAND AVADHUTA vs. COMMISSIONER OF POLICE, CALCUTTA [1984 AIR SC 51], the Supreme Court of India appears to have thought that a ritualized Tandava dance which is performed by followers of the Anada Marg sect, may constitute a \u201cpractice\u201d of that sect but held that, in any event, it was not essential that such a \u201cpractice\u201d be performed in public. In this regard, the petitioners have submitted that, the tenets of Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses require them to engage in house to-house visits for the purposes of evangelizing and that, therefore, such house-to-house visits are a \u201cpractice\u201d of their religion, which",

    "text": "brings these acts within the ambit of Article 14 (1)(e). I do not agree with that contention because, in my view, engaging in house to-house visits for the purpose of evangelizing, is in the nature of a religious duty or obligation placed on the petitioners, similar to other religious duties or obligations such as obedience to the Ten Commandments, loving one\u201fs neighbor and Christian charity. Engaging in house to-house visits is not in the nature of a \u201cpractice\u201d which is referred to in Article 14(1)(e) of the Constitution and which, as identified earlier, means and refers to customary or traditional rituals, ceremonies or acts which are performed in the course of or allied to or consequent to acts of \u201cworship\u201d and \u201cobservance\u201d of a religion or a set of beliefs. If I may also say here, by way of a comment only, it seems to me that the performance of a religious duty or obligation is, usually, personal to the individual adherent of a religion or belief and is done by him alone or together with others who are also performing the same religious duty or obligation. The acts done in the performance of a religious duty or obligation, usually, do not require the participation of others who do not share the same religious duty or obligation and are, usually, of no concern to them and do not affect them. I doubt there can be an enforceable right to unilaterally perform one\u201fs religious duties and obligations in a manner which affects others who may be disinterested or unwilling to participate or listen or even hostile. Those questions, if they are to be decided, will have to await due consideration in an appropriate case. As a result of the conclusions reached with regard to the import of the words \u201cworship, observance, practice\u201d used in Article 14(1)(e), the discussion which the petitioners were having with Chandima would fall within the ambit of Article 14(1)(e) only if it can be regarded as properly falling within the scope of the word \u201cteaching;\u201d used in Article 14(1)(e). In that connection, as is well known, the word \u201cteaching\u201d is used, in common usage, to mean the act of imparting knowledge to another, who is the student of the teacher. Thus, the Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines the verb \u201cteach\u201d as meaning \u201cImpart information about or the knowledge of (a subject or skill); give instruction, training, or lessons (in a subject etc), Impart information or knowledge to (a person); educate, train, or instruct (a person) ;give (a person) moral guidance\u201d and \u201cEnable (a person) to do something by instruction or training; show or explain to (a person) a fact or how to do something by instruction, lessons, etc\u201d and \u201cImpart knowledge or information; act as a teacher; give instruction, lessons or training.\u201d The noun \u201cteaching\u201d is defined as \u201cThe action of TEACH verb; the imparting of information or knowledge; the occupation, profession or function of a teacher.\u201d. It is necessary to now examine and determine whether the discussion the petitioners were having with Chandima on 01st March 2014 can be properly regarded as being an act of \u201cteaching\u201d within the ordinary meaning of the word, which has been described above. When determining this question, it is necessary to first examine and determine the nature of the overall exercise within which this discussion took place. That is",

If that was the case, it would have been proper to examine the nature of the discussion in the context of it being a stand-alone act. However, in the present case, the discussion occurred in the course of and as an integral part of a programme of house-to-house visits which the petitioners intended to carry out as a public ministry of the Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses. Therefore, the discussion with Chandima should be regarded within the context of the intended programme of house-to-house visits and as an incident of that intended programme. It should not be artificially separated from the overall exercise within which it occurred. The discussion must be regarded as having the same character and nature as the programme which it was a part of. As a result, the real question before this Court is not whether the discussion the petitioners were having with Chandima can be properly regarded as being an act of \u201cteaching\u201d but, instead, whether the programme of house-to-house visits which the petitioners intended to carry out [and within which the discussion with Chandima occurred] can be properly regarded as being an act of \u201cteaching\u201d within the ordinary meaning of the word. In this regard, it is evident from the definitions of the word cited earlier that, the act of \u201cteaching\u201d involves a process of the education of a student [or group of students] by a teacher who, by means of instructions, lessons and training, imparts knowledge and skills to the student [or students]. The resulting process of \u201cteaching\u201d is usually consensual since, on the one hand, the teacher voluntarily agrees to perform the duty of teaching and, on the other hand, the student voluntarily seeks the teacher because he wishes to learn from the teacher. The act of \u201cteaching\u201d is usually pre-arranged and entered into with deliberation and for the individual benefit of both the teacher and the student. It usually takes place at a pre-determined place which is known to and convenient to both teacher and student. Usually, the identity of both the teacher and the student are known to each other or their agents, before the act of \u201cteaching\u201d commences. No doubt, there will be instances where the act of \u201cteaching\u201d occurs spontaneously, as for example where an elder teaches a child or a friend teaches another friend. However, in general, it can be fairly said that, the act of \u201cteaching\u201d is usually pre-arranged and consensual. Further, the act of \u201cteaching\u201d usually involves a personal relationship between the teacher and the student However, when one looks at the nature [this was examined and identified earlier] of a typical programme of house-to-house visits which the petitioners engage in as part of a public ministry of the Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses, it is very clear that these characteristics of the act and process of \u201cteaching\u201d are absent. Such programmes of house-to-house visits would entail members of the denomination setting off in groups of two or more in order to meet strangers by knocking on doors or speaking with them upon sight and then seeking to engage them in a discussion of the type described earlier. Some of the persons they accost will brush off the attempt to make a contact. Others will agree to a discussion. There is a distinctly random quality in the manner in which members of the denomination find persons they are able to",

The identities of the parties to the process are not known to each other prior to the house-to-house visit. A programme of house-to-house visits in the course of a public ministry carried out by Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses is more in the nature of an exercise which attempts to communicate a message on a mass scale and uses a \u201chit or miss\u201d strategy. On the basis of this analysis, I am of the view that, a discussion which takes place between members of Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses and a member of the public during the course of a programme of house-to-house visits carried out as part of a public ministry of Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses, does not constitute an act or process of \u201cteaching\u201d within the meaning of Article 14(1)(e) of the Constitution. For the reasons set out above, I conclude that, the discussion the petitioners were having with Chandima cannot be properly regarded as being an instance of petitioners manifesting their religion \u201cin worship, observance, practice and teaching;\u201d, within the meaning of and as contemplated by Article 14(1)(e) of the Constitution. Consequently, the prevention of the continuation of that discussion by the 1st respondent and police officers acting on his directions and with his authority, does not constitute a violation of the petitioners\u201f fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 14(1)(e) of the Constitution. In their petition, the petitioners have alleged that, at the inquiry held on 15th March 2014, the 2nd respondent directed the petitioners not to discuss their religion with Buddhists. However, the proceedings of that inquiry marked \u201c2R1\u201d do not suggest that such a direction was made by the 2nd respondent. The affidavit marked \u201cP2\u201d affirmed by the 1st petitioners\u201f husband also does not specifically state that the 2nd respondent directed the petitioners not to discuss their religion with Buddhists. In these circumstances, the claim made by the petitioners that the 2nd respondent directed the petitioners not to discuss their religion with Buddhists, remains unsubstantiated. For the reasons set out above, I hold that, there has been no violation of the petitioners\u201f rights guaranteed by Article 14(1)(e). I must make it clear that, the determination I have just made is that, the petitioners\u201f fundamental rights under Article 14(1)(e) were not violated. As I mentioned earlier, the discussion the petitioners and Chandima were having, would, ordinarily, have been lawful. But, the issue before this Court, was not the legality of the discussion. Instead, the issue before this Court was whether the prevention of the continuation of that discussion, denied the petitioners\u201f their fundamental right guaranteed by Article 14(1)(e) to manifest their \u201creligion \u2026.in worship, observance, practice and teaching;\u201d It must be understood that, the petitioners were not breaking any Law when they were having that discussion. They should not have been arrested and I have previously held that the arrest was unlawful. In addition, the petitioners may have civil remedies against the police officers and others.

    "text": "discussions about religion between people of different beliefs and faiths are lawful and are a valued trait of a civilized society. Before concluding, it is incumbent on me to try and identify, from the standpoint of the law, the character of a programme of house-to-house visits in the course of a public ministry carried out by Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses. This question should not be left hanging in the air. In India, where the right to \u201cpropagate\u201d a religion is conferred by Article 25 (1) of the Constitution of India, Mukherjea J, in COMMISSIONER, HINDU RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, MADRAS vs. SRI LAKSHMINDRA THIRTHA SWAMIAR OF SRI SHIRUR MUTT [at p.289] that, referred to the word \u201cpropagate\u201d in the sense of the right conferred on a person to \u201cdisseminate his ideas for the edification of others.\u201d. In REV. STANISLAUS vs. MADHYA PRADESH [AIR SC 1977 908 at p. 911] Ray CJ was of the view that, the word \u201cpropagate\u201d used in Article 25 (1) conferred a right \u201cto transmit or spread one\u201fs religion by an exposition of its tenets.\u201d. In arriving at this view, Ray CJ drew on the definition of the word \u201cpropagate\u201d in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary which defined the word to mean \u201cto spread from person to person, or from place to place, to disseminate, diffuse (a statement, belief, practice etc)\u201d. and the definition of the word in the Century Dictionary which states \u201cTo transmit or spread from person to person or from place to place, carry forward or onward; diffuse; extend; as to propagate a report; to propagate the Christian religion\u201d. The more recent 5th edition of the Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines the verb \u201cpropagate\u201d as meaning \u201cCause to grow in numbers or amount; extend the bounds of; spread (esp.an idea, practice etc) from place to place.\u201d and \u201cGrow more widespread or numerous, increase, spread.\u201d. The noun \u201cpropagation\u201d is defined as \u201cThe action of spreading an idea, practice etc, from place to place.\u201d. It is evident to me that, the character of a programme of house-to-house visits carried out as part of a public ministry of Jehovah\u201fs Witnesses [which was identified earlier], falls squarely within the description of an act of \u201cpropagation\u201d. Although the Constitution of India, which is a secular State, confers the right to \u201cpropagate\u201d a religion, our Constitution does not. The Constitution of India would have, undoubtedly been considered by the drafters of our Constitution and, having done so, they appear to have taken a considered decision to omit granting a right to \u201cpropagate\u201d religion or beliefs in Sri Lanka and to grant only a more private and confined right to \u201cteach\u201d religion or beliefs. There could have been reasons for that decision, including the vital importance of taking measures to preserve social harmony and amity, which have proved to be fragile at times, in a geographically small country with a rapidly growing population which is multi-ethnic, multi-religious and economically disparate. Regrettably, there have been many lessons in our history, of the horrendous consequences of fractures in social harmony and amity. The drafters of our Constitution may have also had in their minds, that, unlike in avowedly secular India, Article 9 of our Constitution vests in the Republic, a duty to give Buddhism the foremost place.",

In S.C. Determination No. 2/2001 and S.C. Determination No. 19/2003, this Court has adverted to the fact that there is no constitutionally protected right to propagate religion or beliefs. To conclude, I hold that the petitioners\u201f fundamental rights under Article 12(1) and Article 13(1) have been violated by the 1st respondent. I hold that the petitioners are entitled to compensation for the wrongful arrest and wrongful detention they were forced to undergo and for the harassment that was unnecessarily, unreasonably and unlawfully meted out to them by the 1st respondent and police officers acting under his directions and with his authority. I direct the State to pay the petitioners Rs.50,000/- each, as compensation. Judge of the Supreme Court S. Eva Wanasundera, PC J. I agree",
