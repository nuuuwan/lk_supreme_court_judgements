Argued on 31.05.2018 Decided on 14.12.2018 Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The Director General, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed a

special leave to appeal application challenging the decision by the Court of Appeal in CA 260/2007

delivered on 17.10.2011.

3 As revealed before us, the said Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had

forwarded an indictment against one Imbulana Liyanage Dharmawardana under section 23 A (3) of

the Bribery Act (as amended)

The trial against the said accused Imbulana Liyanage Dharmawardana was taken up before the High

Court of Colombo and at the conclusion of the said trial, the learned High Court Judge of Colombo

had found the said accused guilty of the indictment against him and sentenced him as follows;

1) Four years Rigorous Imprisonment

2) Fine of Rs. 2500/- with a default term of six months

3) Further fine of Rs. 12, 000, 00/- under section 26 (a) of the Bribery Act (as amended) with a

default term of 5 years Rigorous Imprisonment.

(Jail terms to run consecutively)

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the accused preferred an appeal to the Court

of Appeal and the said appeal was taken up for argument on 16th June 2011. During the said appeal

it was revealed that the documents relied upon by the prosecution in the High Court Trial and was

marked and produced during the trial as P-1 to P-23 were not available to be examined both by the

counsel and court since the said documents had been misplaced from the High Court Registry.

During the argument before the Court of Appeal, the counsel for the accused-appellant took up a

preliminary objection, that he was unable to effectively prosecute the appeal due to the absence of

the marked documents.

In this regard the learned counsel for the Accused-Appellant-Respondent had taken up the position

before the Court of Appeal that they would not object if the prosecution, in the very least, tendered

4 photocopies of the documents that are missing, but the prosecution failed the submit even

photocopies of the lost documents before Court of Appeal.

The Court of Appeal by its order dated 17.10.2011 held that the trial courts failure to send all the

documents to Court of Appeal has violated the undeniable rights of the appellant including his right

of appeal and allowed the appeal by acquitting and discharging the Accused-Appellant.

Aggrieved by the said judgment the Complainant-Respondent-Appellant sought special leave to

appeal from the said judgment and when it was supported before the Supreme Court on

08.01.2012, court granted special leave on the questions of law identified in paragraph 18 (a) to (e)

along with a further question identified during the support stage.

The questions of law on which the special leave was granted can be summarized as follows;

a) Did the Court of Appeal err in law by holding that, the failure of the trial court to send all

documents to the Court of Appeal violated the applicants right of appeal in the

circumstances of the present case?

b) Did the Honourable Court of Appeal err in law holding that productions referred to in the

decision of Leelananda vs. Ernest de. Silva 1990 (2) Sri LR 237 referred to real evidence

and not to documents?

c) Did the Court of Appeal err in law by holding that the Court of Appeal does not have the

power to dispense with the examination of all or any of the documents those that are

not admitted by the contending parties?

d) Did the Honourable Court of Appeal fail to consider the learned High Court Judges

judgment and the proceedings to ascertain, as to what documents and contents thereof

were admitted in the course of the trial?

5

e) Did the Honourable Court of Appeal err in law by holding that, the appellant had

disputed documents P-17 to P-22 and that, there are certain deliberate false statements

in the written submission of the state especially where the state has taken up the

position that all the lost documents were admitted by the defence at the trial?

f) In the circumstances of the case, did the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal err in

upholding the preliminary objection raised by the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Respondent?

As submitted on behalf of the Complainant-Respondent-Appellant, the decision to acquit and

discharge the Accused-Appellant-Respondent by the Court of Appeal by its order dated 17.10.2011

was arrived by only considering the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the Accused-Appellant-

Respondent without going into the merits of the case and therefore it is premature for the Court of

Appeal to reach the said decision. In support of the above contention the learned Deputy Solicitor

General who appeared for the Complainant-Respondent-Appellant submitted that;

a) During the trial before the High Court, prosecution led the evidence of two witnesses

namely G.A. David Singho Authorized Officer from the Commission to Investigate Bribery

and Corruption and N. Sooriyakumara Director Finance of Sri Lanka Customs.

b) During their evidence documents from P-1 to P-23 were marked by the prosecution.

c) Out of the said documents, documents P-1 to P-16 and P-23 were admitted by the

defence and therefore no additional witnesses were summoned to prove those

documents.

d) At the conclusion of the prosecution case, an application was made on behalf of the

accused under section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to discharge the

accused.

6

e) The said application made under section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act was

rejected by the Learned High Court Judge and defence was called from the Accused

above named.

f) The Accused elected to give evidence from the witness box and was subject to cross

examination by the prosecution counsel.

g) At the end of both the prosecution and defence cases, both parties moved to make oral

submissions as well as to produce written submission.

h) On 22.02.2007 both counsel made oral submissions. The prosecuting counsel had

produced the marked document namely P-1 to P-23 in open court once he conclude his

oral submissions.

i) The learned Trial Judge delivered his order on 23.03.2007 convicting the Accused-

Appellant. In the said order the learned Trial Judge had considered all the documents

produced at the trial by making reference to the documents and producing the contents

of the said documents in his judgment.

and argued that the non-availability of the marked documents at the appeal stage is not

per-se an impediment to consider the appeal unless it involves interpretation of the said

documents. It was further argued by the learned Deputy Solicitor General that the function of the

Appellate Court is not to engage in an examination of the productions but to consider whether the

trial judge applied the correct standard and drawn correct inferences on the facts as found by the

trial judge.

When considering the material placed before this court it is observed that the Accused-Appellant-

Respondent had faced charges under section 23A (3) of the Bribery Act for acquiring assets in excess

7 of his known income. When establishing the said charge the prosecution had mainly relied on

number of documents to establish the accuseds known income as well as acquired assets.

Unlike in any other trial before a trial court, an Indictment forwarded under section 23(A) (3) of the

Bribery Act depend largely on documentary evidence, to establish the known income as well as the

known assets and liabilities of the accused.

As revealed from the evidence placed before the trial court as well as from the judgment of the trial

judge, it appears that there was no challenge by the accused with regard to the known assets and/or

the known expenditure of the accused for the relevant period, and infact the documentation with

regard to known assets and liabilities were admitted and produced before the trial court. The said

admitted documents namely P-1 to P-16 had been referred to by the trial judge in his judgment at

page 4 to 8.

In addition to the above admissions, with regard to the known assets and/or known expenditure, a

further admission was recorded with regard to P-19 which indicted the salaries, overtime and

traveling money received by the accused during the period relevant to the indictment.

Rest of the documents produced at the trial was not admitted by the accused and the said

documents are as follows;

P- 17 Affidavit of the accused made on form 5 of the Bribery Act

P-18 Declaration of assets and liabilities of the accused made under the Declaration of

Assets and Liabilities Act

P-20 Rewards received by the accused from Sri Lanka Custom

P-21 Show cause notice issued to the accused

P-22 Show cause affidavit by the accused

8 During the arguments before this court the learned Presidents Counsel who represented the

Accused-Appellant-Respondent whilst stressing the importance of the availability of documents at

the appeal stage and submitted that the prosecution had relied on the said documents when

securing a conviction before the High Court and the failure to produce them or any one of them in

appeal would seriously prejudice the appellants rights during the argument before Appellate Court

since the documents referred to above go to the very root of the conviction of the Accused-

Appellant-Respondent.

I do agree with the learned Presidents Counsels above submission that the documents referred to

above had played a major role in the trial before the High Court and would be relevant to the appeal

but reluctant to agree when the learned Counsel submitted that the appellant would be seriously

prejudiced for non-availability of productions at the appeal stage.

As referred to above in this judgment, the decision to allow the appeal by the Court of Appeal was

reached on a preliminary objection raised by the learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellant on the

non-availability of documents marked during the High Court trial without considering the main

appeal before the said court. However when reaching the said decision their lordships of the Court

of Appeal had considered the importance of one such document namely document produced

marked P-20 in the following manner,

Counsel for the Appellant contended that, out of the said documents P-20 is of utmost

significance as it is clear from the evidence that the document did not set out the full

particulars of the rewards the accused had obtained during the relevant period. At page 325

of the brief the Customs official who gave evidence had stated in evidence that there could

have been other rewards granted to the Appellant other than those contained in the

document. He has stated in his evidence that P-20 is not comprehensive and did not contain

9

particulars of all the rewards granted to the Appellant. The particular piece of evidence was

corroborative of the evidence of the Appellant. The Appellant in his evidence had stated that

the said document contained only a part of the rewards that were granted to him by the Sri

Lanka Customs. According to the evidence of the customs officer (at page 325) it is apparent

that P-20 does not reflect all the rewards granted to the Appellant hence failure on the part

of the prosecution to produce an exhaustive and comprehensive list of rewards casts a

serious doubt as to the correctness of the amount contained in the indictment. In this

background P-20 is of paramount importance to this court in arriving at a fair decision.

I cannot understand as to how their lordships of the Court of Appeal made the said observation

without going through the merits of the main appeal before the Court of Appeal since the Learned

Trial Judge had considered each and every document produced at the trial in his judgment. As

further observed by this Court, their lordships of the Court of Appeal had misdirected themselves

when they come to the said conclusion without giving due consideration to the Judgment

pronounced by the trial judge.

Section 331 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 had provided an accused person to

lodge a leave to appeal application before the High Court, and subsection (f) of the section 331 (4)

provides to contain in the said appeal a plain and concise statement of the grounds of Appeal.

As further observed by this court, right to appeal is guaranteed in a fair trial and Sri Lanka being a

state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) had recognized the

provisions of the said covenant by introducing the said provisions into our legislation. Section 4 (2)

of the ICCPR Act No 56 of 2007 had guaranteed the right of appeal as follows;

10

4 (2) Every person convicted of criminal offence under any written law, shall have

the right to appeal to a higher court against such conviction and any sentence

imposed.

However when considering the preliminary objection raised before the Court of Appeal, their

lordships whilst drawing their lordships attention to the case of Wijerathne V. Republic of Sri Lanka

78 NLR 49 had discussed the principle of a fair trial.

As submitted by both parties before this court, the Accused-Appellant before the Court of Appeal

had not raised any complaint of depriving his rights before the trial court, either guaranteed under

the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 or guaranteed under section

4 (1) of the ICCPR act No 56 of 2007.

In the said circumstances, I see no relevance of the said decision to the appeal before the Court of

Appeal.

Their lordships of the Court of Appeal had further considered the decision reported in 1990 2 Sri LR

237 relied on behalf of the state and observed the difference between a productions and a

document but failed to consider the principle laid down in the said decision to the effect that, In

appeals this court has to consider whether the trial judge applied the correct standard and drew the

correct inferences on the facts as found by him.

As observed by me, the said principle identified in the case of Leelananda V. Earnest de. Silva

reported in 1990 (2) Sri LR 237 had clearly identified the role of an Appellate Judge in Appeal and for

the Appellate Court to consider the above, they should hear the main appeal. When taking up the

main appeal, the Appellate Court should always consider the relevancy of the documents to the

case in hand. If the trial judge had failed to draw the correct inference on facts before him, the

11 documents before the trial court plays a major role in the appeal before the Appellate Court.

However for the Appellate Court to consider whether the trial judge had failed to draw the correct

inference on the facts before him, the Appellate Court should hear the main appeal and then only

the Appellate Court can consider the importance of the documents which are not before court at

the Appeal stage.

In the said circumstances, it is not correct for the Appellate Court to conclude that an accused

person is deprived of a fair trial, when the documents relied at the trial stage are missing without

considering the importance of the said document for the appeal before them.

In the said circumstances, I answer the questions of Law raised in this appeal in favour of the

Complainant-Respondent-Appellant and conclude that their lordships of the Court of Appeal had

erred in law when they upheld the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the Accused-Appellant-

Respondent.

I therefore set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 17.10.2011 and direct the Court of

Appeal to hear the main appeal in this case.

Appeal allowed.
