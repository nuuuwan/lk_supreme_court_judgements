He had started smoking when he was a teenager. Over time, he became a heavy smoker. In the month of September 1996, he was diagnosed with incurable cancer. The plaintiff\u2019s husband died on 13th April 2001. He was then 60 years old. The Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner/Appellant [\u201cthe defendant\u201d] is a limited liability Company. It is the sole manufacturer of cigarettes in Sri Lanka. The defendant also distributes, sells and markets the cigarettes it manufactures. Further, at the times material to this action, the defendant advertised and promoted the sale of the cigarettes it manufactured. Prior to his death, the plaintiff\u2019s husband instituted D.C. Colombo Case No. 21163/M against the defendant praying for the recovery of damages on account of the cancer, which he alleged was caused by smoking cigarettes manufactured by the defendant. He died during the pendency of that case. The plaintiff made an application to be substituted in place of her deceased husband. The District Court made Order refusing this application for substitution on the basis that the cause of action claimed by the plaintiff\u2019s husband was personal to him and did not survive his death. The plaintiff did not challenge that Order in the Court of Appeal. On 11th April 2003, the plaintiff instituted this action against the defendant, pleading four alleged causes of action and praying for the recovery of a sum of Rs.5,000,000/- from the defendant.

Colombo Case No. 21163/M; (k) in these circumstances, the plaintiff has suffered loss and damages which are quantified at a sum of Rs. 5,000,000/-; (l) based on these alleged factual averments, the plaintiff claimed four causes of action upon which she claimed the defendant was liable to pay this sum of Rs.5,000,000/- to her: ie: causes of action upon the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence, alleged fraudulent acts and alleged violations of several provisions of the Sale of Goods Ordinance and Foods Act.",

On the other hand, in its written submissions tendered in the District Court, the defendant submitted that, the four preliminary issues should be answered in the defendant\u2019s favour and the action be dismissed since: (i) the plaint is prolix; (iii) the plaint does not disclose a cause of action because the plaintiff is not seeking to recover compensation for patrimonial loss but is, instead, seeking to recover loss and damages for loss of love, affection, care and protection, which is not recoverable under our law; (iii) the plaint is vague due to the plaintiff\u2019s failure to plead the exact amount of the loss and damage caused by the loss of support consequent to her husband\u2019s death; (iv) the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action \u201cemanates from the time her husband came to know that he was suffering from cancer\u201d - ie: in September 1996 - and, therefore, this action is ex facie prescribed on the face of the plaint, since it has been filed long after the expiry of two years from September 1996; and (v) the Court\u2019s refusal to substitute the plaintiff in the place of her deceased husband in D.C.

    "text": "(i) Whether the Court of Appeal failed to appreciate as to what the cause of action of the plaintiff is, against the defendant ? In paragraph [16] (a) of its petition to this Court, the defendant stated the basis on which it raised this question of law by citing the definition of a \u201cCause of Action\u201d in section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code and pleading that, \u201cIn the circumstances, it is submitted with respect that the date of death of the Plaintiff\u2019s husband cannot be construed as the date of the commencement of the `wrong\u2019 allegedly committed by the Defendant that gives rise to all the damages that the plaintiff seeks\u201d: (ii) Whether the Court of Appeal failed to appreciate that, the plaintiff\u2019s action is prescribed on the face of the plaint, in that, inter alia, the wrong for the prevention or redress of which the action was brought arose well prior to two years before the institution of action ? (iii) Whether the Court of Appeal failed to appreciate that, on an application of the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in PROF. PRIYANI DE SOYZA VS. RIENZIE ARSECULERATNE, the plaintiff is not entitled to the damages prayed for ? It is evident from paragraph [16] (a) of the petition to this Court, that the first question of law is raised on the basis of the defendant\u2019s contention that, the plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action did not arise upon the death of her husband but, instead, arose in 1996, when he contracted cancer. The second question of law raises the specific issue of whether the plaintiff\u2019s action is prescribed on the face of the plaint because the alleged cause of action arose prior to two years before the action was instituted. Thus, both the first and second questions of law relate back to the defendant\u2019s issue no. [45] which asked: \u201cIs the plaintiff\u2019s action prescribed on the face of the plaint ?\u201d. Therefore, these two questions of law can be considered together. In this regard, it is evident from the averments in the plaint that, the plaintiff\u2019s alleged causes of action are based on the premise that the defendant\u2019s wrongful and/or unlawful acts caused the death of her husband and that, as a result of the death of her husband, she has suffered loss and damage, which she has quantified in a sum Rs. 5,000,000/-. It is also seen that, the plaintiff\u2019s action is in the nature of an Aquilian Action for the recovery of alleged loss and damages caused to the plaintiff by the wrongful acts and/or omissions of the defendant, which are said to consist of culpa with regard to the cause of action based on alleged negligence and also dolus with regard to the other causes of action based on alleged fraudulent conduct and alleged violation of statutory safeguards.",

In LEGAL INSURANCE COMPANY LTD vs. BOTES [1963 1 SALR 608], where the widow of a man killed in road accident, sued to recover compensation for damages caused to her as a result of his death, Holmes J stated [at p. 614] with regard to the nature of the action, \u201cThe remedy relates to material loss `caused to the dependents of the deceased man by his death\u2019. It aims at placing them in as good a position, as regards maintenance , as they would have been in if the deceased had not been killed.\u201d. Accordingly, Mckerron states [The Law of Delict 7th ed. at p. 149], \u201c\u2026.. the dependents of the deceased can claim compensation for the pecuniary loss they have suffered in consequence of the death.\u201d. Similarly, Macintosh and Scoble [Negligence in Delict 3rd ed. at p. 203], also writing on the South African Law, observe, \u201c\u2026.. the right of action comes to the dependents quite independently, and is not derived from the deceased or his estate.\u201d. As regards the Law in Sri Lanka, Wikramanayake states [The Law of Delict in Ceylon at p.39], \u201cThis action is available to those to whom the deceased was legally bound to support and the damages awarded is the actual pecuniary loss.\u201d.",

    "text": "With regard to the first and second questions of law, it is the plaintiff\u2019s position that her alleged causes of action arose only upon the death of her husband. On the other hand, the defendant\u2019s position is that, the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action arose when she became aware, in 1996, that her husband contracted cancer and while he was alive. The aforesaid statements of the law make it apparent that, it is the plaintiff\u2019s position which is correct since, as set out above, her alleged causes of action to recover compensation for patrimonial loss she claims to have suffered as a result of the death of her husband, only arose upon the death of her husband which deprived her of the patrimonial benefits she received from him during his lifetime. In other words, the causes of action she claims in the plaint came into existence only upon the death of her husband. Until that time, she was dependent on her husband and she had no personal cause of action against the defendant. Her husband may [or may not] have, during his lifetime, had a cause of action against the defendant for loss and damage caused to him as a result of having contracted cancer after smoking cigarettes manufactured and marketed by the defendant. However, any such possible cause of action was personal to him and was extinguished upon his death. As set out above, the cause of action now claimed by the plaintiff is entirely different to any cause of action that her husband may have had during his lifetime.",

In this connection, Pulle J also cited Salmond [Law of Torts 1953 ed. p. 396] which states, \u201cNevertheless the cause of action conferred upon the relatives of the deceased by the Act is a new cause of action, and not merely a continuance of that which was formerly vested in the deceased himself. It is ' new in its species, new in its quality, new in its principle, in every way new [1 (1884) App. Cases 59 at 70.]\u201d On the same lines, in NANDAKEERTHI vs. KARUNARATNE [ 2004 1 SLR 205], where the widow of a person killed in a road accident claimed compensation from the owner of the vehicle, Wijayaratne J observed [at p.208], with regard to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover compensation, \u201cSuch right depends on the fact of the plaintiff being a dependent of the deceased where death deprived her of such dependence.\u201d.",

    "text": "The case of SUPPRAMANIA CHETTY vs. THE FISCAL, WESTERN PROVINCE [19 NLR 129] cited by the defendant, was with regard to the damages caused to the plaintiff by the negligence of the Fiscal which resulted in the theft of goods seized in execution of a decree entered in favour of the plaintiff. It is not relevant to the present case. However, when the observation made by Schneider J [at p. 139] that, \u201c\u2026.. the rule is well established that prescription generally runs in cases of tort from the date of the tort, and not from the occurrence of the damage. But, there is an exception to this where the original act itself was no wrong, and only becomes so by reason of subsequent damage\u201d is applied to the present case, it confirms the aforesaid position that the plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action in the present case before us arose only upon the death of her husband. That is because, the tort or delict which the plaintiff claims is the defendant causing the death of her husband and the damages caused to the plaintiff commenced only upon the death of her husband. The decision in CARTLEDGE vs. E. JOPLING & SONS LTD [1963 1 AER 341] which was cited by the defendant, is also not relevant to the present case. That decision was with regard to the plaintiff having contracted pneumoconiosis as a result of adverse working conditions and the interpretation of section 2 (1) of the Limitation Act, 1939. It has no bearing on a cause of action which accrues to the dependents of a person who dies as a result of tortious or delictual acts of another. As set out above, it is very clear that, the alleged causes of action claimed by the plaintiff in this action arose only upon the death of her husband on 13th April 2001. This action has been filed on 11th April 2003. Therefore, this action has been filed within two years of the time when the plaintiff\u2019s alleged causes of action arose and within the two year limitation period specified in section 9 of the Prescription Ordinance, as being applicable to actions for the recovery of \u201closs, injury or damage\u201d,",

    "text": "Thus, it is apparent that, the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action arose when her husband contracted cancer in 1996 is devoid of any merit. Accordingly, the first and second questions of law are answered in the negative. The third question of law asks whether the Court of Appeal failed to appreciate that, on an application of the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in PROF. PRIYANI DE SOYZA VS. RIENZI ARSECULERATNE [2001 2 SLR 293], the plaintiff is not entitled to the damages prayed for in the plaint. In this regard, the defendant contends that, the plaintiff\u2019s causes of action are to recover compensation for alleged loss and damage caused to her as a result of being deprived of the care and companionship of her husband and for the mental agony caused to her following the death of husband. The defendant goes on to submit that, the defendant is not entitled to such damages because, as the Dheeraratne J held in PROF. PRIYANI DE SOYZA VS. RIENZIE ARSECULERATNE [2001 2 SLR 293 at p.303-304], damages are recoverable in an Acquilian Action only on account of calculable patrimonial loss and also \u201cinjured feelings arising out of and flowing naturally from physical hurt done\u201d but not on account of \u201cmental distress or wounded feelings causing no physical injury\u201d or \u201closs of care and companionship\u201d. However, a perusal of the plaint shows that, the defendant\u2019s aforesaid submission is factually incorrect since the plaintiff has not limited her claims to alleged loss and damage caused to her as a result of being deprived of the care and companionship of her husband and for mental agony caused to her following the death of husband. Instead, the plaintiff has claimed loss and damages caused to her as a result of, inter alia: (i) losing the care [\u201c\u0d86\u0dbb\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dcf\u0dc0\u201d], protection [\u201c\u0dbb\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dab\u0dba\u201d] and maintenance [\u201c \u201d] which she received from her husband; and (ii) being deprived of the pecuniary benefit she would receive, as the heir of the estate of her deceased husband, from the monies which would have been payable to her husband under a decree entered in D.C. Colombo Case No. 21163/M. These heads of alleged damages may, if proved by evidence to that effect, constitute patrimonial loss which the plaintiff suffered as a result of the death of her husband. For example, in the celebrated case of THE UNION GOVERNMENT vs. WARNEKE [1911 AD 657] where the plaintiff\u2019s wife was killed in a railway accident and he sued to recover compensation for damages on account of the deprivation of her comfort and society and also on account of the loss of her assistance in the care, clothing and upbringing of his seven children, it was held that, while he was not entitled to damages on account of the loss of her comfort and society, he would be entitled to recover damages for such pecuniary loss, as he may prove to have sustained, as a result of the deprivation of her assistance in the care, clothing and upbringing of his children. Further, as Holmes J stated in LEGAL INSURANCE COMPANY LTD vs. BOTES [at p. 614], \u201c \u2026.. material losses as well as benefits and prospects must be considered.\u201d",

    "text": "It is obvious that the question of whether these alleged damages are in the nature of patrimonial loss or not and whether these alleged damages were, in fact, sustained, will be mixed questions of fact and law which can only be ascertained at the trial, upon evidence placed before the Court. These questions cannot be answered by simply looking at the averments in the plaint, as the defendant seems to suggest. It is apt to cite here the often quoted observation by Kulatunge J in FONSEKA vs. FONSEKA [at p.100] that the law requires a plaint to disclose a cause of action and that, \u201cThe law does not require that the plaint should make out a prima facie case which is what the Defendants-Appellants appear to insist on, nor are the Plaintiffs required to state their evidence by which the claim would be proved.\u201d For these reasons, the defendant\u2019s remaining contention as embodied in the third question of law, is not only factually incorrect, it is also devoid of substance in law. Therefore, the third question of law is also answered in the negative. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed. The Orders of the District Court and the Court of Appeal are affirmed. As set out above, this appeal, which is on preliminary issues, has no merit. However, by its applications to the Court of Appeal and to this Court, the defendant company has succeeded in delaying the trial by more than 12 years and would have caused the plaintiff to incur expenses which are likely to have imposed a difficult burden on her The plaintiff would have also been put to considerable inconvenience. In another case, these obstacles may even have led to the plaintiff, whose resources are likely to be limited, caving in and giving up the action. In these circumstances, the defendant company shall pay the plaintiff a sum of Rs. 400,000/- as costs, within one month of today. The District Court should hear and determine the trial, on its merits based on the evidence and the law, as soon as possible",
