SISIRA J. DE ABREW, J.

Heard Counsel in support of their respective cases. We are inclined to grant

Leave in this case. Leave to Appeal is granted on questions of law stated in

paragraph 12 “b” & “c” of the Petition dated 12.06.2018 which are set out

below;

b. Did their Lordships of the Court of Appeal misinterpret the

impugned document P21 to come to the conclusion that it refers to

the imposition of personal liability on the respondent liquidator?

c. If so, did their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in law by

quashing the award embodied in the impugned document marked

P21?

Parties now agree to argue the main case and the submissions were made by

the parties in respect of the main case. The 5th Respondent-Petitioner (D.K.

Wijesundara) was working in this particular Company called Janatha Estate

Fertilizer Enterprises Ltd., from 1981. The Commissioner of Labour by its

letter dated 09.10.2014 directed the Liquidator of the Company to pay

Rs.2,136,415.50 to D.K. Wijesundara, the 5th Respondent-Petitioner. Being

aggrieved by the said decision of the Commissioner of Labour (P21) the

Liquidator (Petitioner-Respondent) filed this case in the Court of Appeal seeking

to quash the said document marked P21. The Court of Appeal by its judgment

dated 02.05.2018 exercising the writ jurisdiction quashed the said document

marked P21. We note that the 5th Respondent-Petitioner (D.K. Wijesundara)

has been working in the said Company from 1981 and he is entitled to the said

amount. The Company is now under Liquidation. Under Section 47 of the

Employees’ Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958 as amended by Act No. 16 of

1970, 08 of 1971, 24 of 1971, 26 of 1981, 01 of 1985, 42 of 1988, 14 of 1992

the employer includes Liquidator of a Company. Thus, when the Company is

SC.SPL.LA.NO.160/2018

under Liquidation, it becomes a duty of the Liquidator to comply with the

direction given by the Commissioner of Labour marked P21.

Learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner-Respondent (the Liquidator) too

agrees with this position. When we consider the above matters, we are of the

opinion that the Court of Appeal was in error when they quashed the said

document marked P21. We therefore answer the above questions of law in the

affirmative.

For the above reasons, we set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated

02.05.2018 and dismiss the Writ application filed by the Petitioner-Respondent

in the Court of Appeal.

Appeal allowed.
