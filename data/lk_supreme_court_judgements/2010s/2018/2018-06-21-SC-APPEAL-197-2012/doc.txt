Sisira J de Abrew J

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant hereinafter referred to as the

Plaintiff-Appellant) filed this case against the Defendant-Appellant-Respondent-

Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant-Respondents) for a

declaration of title. The learned District Judge after trial decided the case in favour

of the Plaintiff-Appellant. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned

District Judge, the Defendant-Respondents appealed to the Civil Appellate High

Court. The Civil Appellate High Court by its judgment dated 23.1.2012 set aside

the judgment of the learned District Judge and held in favour of the Defendant-

Respondents. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the Civil Appellate High

Court, the Plaintiff-Appellant has appealed to this court. This court by its order

dated 9.11.2012, granted leave to appeal on questions of law set out in paragraphs

32 (c) and 32 (d) of the Petition of Appeal dated 5.3.2012 which are set out below.

1. Have the Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court misdirected themselves

by failing to consider the fact that the learned Trial Judge before whom the

factual evidence was led has duly evaluated the evidence and arrived at her

judgment dated 23.1.2012?

2. Have the Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court misdirected themselves

by arriving at the finding that the deceased Plaintiff has never disputed her

deserted husband’s ownership despite of the strong and cogent evidence to

the effect that the deceased Plaintiff’s husband has completely deserted the

4

deceased Plaintiff and the child and was living with another woman in

Thanamalwila area in arriving at their final decision?

The Defendant-Respondents have taken up the position that David Perera who is

the husband of the Plaintiff-Appellant by deed No 961 dated 12.10.1991 marked

V1 transferred the property in question to Jamis Siriwardena; that Jamis

Siriwardena by deed No.1024 dated 8.2.1993 marked V3 transferred the property

to the 1st Defendant-Respondent; and that the 1st Defendant-Respondent is the

owner of the property. The Defendant-Respondents sought a declaration that the 1st

Defendant-Respondent is the owner of the property.

The Plaintiff-Appellant claims title to the property by prescription. Has she

obtained the prescriptive title to the property in question? If this question is

answered in the negative her case should fail. I now advert to this question. The

plaintiff is the wife of David Perera. Their marriage has not been dissolved. The

following evidence given by the Plaintiff-Appellant is important to decide the

above question.

Q. Your husband gave the land and the house for you to maintain yourself.

A. Yes.

Q. You possess the property on the title of your husband.

A. I possess the property.

The above evidence demonstrates that her possession is not an adverse

possession. Under Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance for a person to claim

prescriptive title his or her possession should be an adverse possession. Since the

possession of the Plaintiff-Appellant is not adverse possession she is not entitled to

5

claim prescriptive title to the property. Further when wife possesses a property of

her husband she cannot claim prescriptive title under Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance against her husband because such a possession cannot be considered to

be an adverse possession against her husband. In the present case, the Plaintiff-

Appellant is the wife of David Perera who is the owner of the property. David

Perera transferred the property to Siriwardena on 12.10.1991. Thus the declaration

of title Deed No. 333 dated 1.2.1993 written by Plaintiff-Appellant has been

written without her acquiring the prescriptive title. The case was filed in the

District Court on 25.2.1993. When I consider all the above matters, I hold that the

Plaintiff-Appellant has not acquired the prescriptive title to the property and that

Plaintiff-Appellant has not proved that he is the owner of the property. This is a rei

vindicatio action. In an action for rei-vindicatio the plaintiff must prove that he is

the owner of the property. This view is supported by the following judicial

decisions.

In De Silva Vs Gunatilake 32 NLR 217 at 219 Macdonell CJ held thus:

“There is abundant authority that, a party claiming a declaration of title must have

title himself. … The authorities unite in holding that plaintiff must show title to the

corpus in dispute and that if he cannot, the action will not lie.”

In Peiris Vs Savunahamy 54 NLR 207 Dias SPJ (with whom Justice

Gratiaen agreed) held thus:

“Where in an action for declaration of title to land, the Defendant is in possession

of the land in dispute the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that he has dominium.”

In Abeykoon Hamine Vs Appuhamy 52 NLR 49 Dias SPJ (with whom

Jayatilake CJ agreed) observed thus:

6

“This being action for rei vindicatio, and the defendant being in possession, the

initial burden of proof was on the plaintiff to prove that he had dominium to the

land in dispute.”

In Wanigaratne Vs Juwanis Appuhamy 65 NLR 167 Supreme Court held

thus: “In an action rei vindicatio the plaintiff must prove and establish his title. He

cannot ask for a declaration of title in his favour merely on the strength that the

defendant's title is poor or not established.”

Since the Plaintiff-Appellant has not proved that she is the owner of the

property, she is not entitled to succeed in her action filed against the Defendant-

Respondents. The Defendant-Respondents have proved his title. Considering all

the above matters, I answer the above questions of law in the negative. For the

above reasons, I refuse to interfere with the judgment of the Civil Appellate High

Court, affirm the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court and dismiss this

appeal. Considering the facts of this case, I do not make an order for costs.

Judge of the Supreme Court.
