Petitioner avers that after he reached the island on the center of the road he waited for a while along with the said group of people for traffic to be cleared and thereafter crossed the road. At this point, Petitioner alleges that, 1st Respondent (PC 25410) who was directing the traffic at the said Toyota Junction rushed towards him and grabbed him by his shirt and shouted at him in an abusive language stating that he failed to comply with his directions. 1st Respondent has further dealt several blows to the Petitioner\u2019s head with his fist which has caused severe pain to the Petitioner. Despite Petitioner\u2019s repeated cries for help, 1st Respondent has continued to beat the Petitioner and has also lashed out at the Petitioner with his own umbrella until it has fallen apart.",

The whole purpose of objections and written submissions is to place their case by both parties before Court prior to the hearing and when the Petitioner\u2019s objections are taken along with the objections/written submissions filed by the Respondents prior to the hearing, it would not come as a surprise either to the affected parties or to Court and the application could be heard without prejudice to any one\u2019s right. Therefore, as correctly pointed out by the Learned President\u2019s Counsel for the Petitioner, the earliest opportunity the 6th Respondent had of raising the aforementioned preliminary objection was at the time of filing of his objections and written submissions in terms of the Supreme Court Rules, 1990; as the objections and/or the written submissions should have contained any statement of fact and/or issue of law that the 6th Respondent intended to raise at the hearing\u201d)",
