Prasanna Jayawardena, PC, J. The Plaintiff-Respondent-Petitioner/Appellant [\u201cthe plaintiff\u201d] and the 1st Defendant-Respondent-Respondent [\u201cthe 1st defendant\u201d] are brother and sister. The plaintiff instituted this action against the 1st defendant and the 2nd and 3rd Defendants-Appellants-Respondents [\u201cthe 2nd and 3rd defendants\u201d] praying for a declaration that he and the 1st defendant are the joint owners of a land situated in the Kadadara village, which is in the Kegalle District. This land is a paddy field with appurtenant high land which has water sources used for the paddy field. Part of the high land has been asweddumized and is under paddy cultivation. The District Court entered judgment in favour of the plaintiff. In appeal, the High Court set aside that judgment and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s case. The plaintiff sought and obtained leave to appeal from this Court on three questions of law which are set out later on in this judgment. The aforesaid land, which is the subject matter of the action, is described in the schedule to the plaint as the paddy field and appurtenant land called \u201cAswedduma Kumbura together with the Pillewa\u201d also called \u201cTalduwage Deniya\u201d which is shown as Lots \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d in plan no. 329 dated 19th October 1942 made by C.

Lot \u201cB\u201d is described as a \u201cJungle land\u201d having an extent of A:0 R:3 P:30.5. Lot \u201cC\u201d is described as a \u201cDeniya land\u201d having an extent of A:0 R:0 P:15. The aggregate extent of Lots \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d is the aforesaid total extent of A:2 R:2 P:26. Plan no. 329 was produced at the trial marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 1\u201d. The 2nd and 3rd defendants are brothers who own or occupy lands which adjoin the land claimed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff states that, on 03rd May 2005, the 2nd and 3rd defendants entered Lots \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d and claimed ownership of these two Lots and started digging up a section of those Lots. On 15th May 2005, the plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of Avissawella against the 1st defendant and the 2nd and 3rd defendants praying for a declaration that, he and the 1st defendant are the owners of the entirety of the aforesaid land described in the schedule to the plaint - ie: Lots \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d, having a total extent of A:2 R:2 P:26. The plaintiff also prayed for an interim injunction restraining the 2nd and 3rd defendants from entering Lots \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d of the land claimed by the plaintiff. As set out in the plaint, the plaintiff\u2019s case, in brief, is that: from prior to 1952, R.A.P. Ranasinghe was the owner of and possessed the entire land described in the schedule to the plaint and shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d; R.A.P. Ranasinghe transferred this land to J. A. Baba Nona and D. Jane Nona by deed no. 976 dated 07th November 1952, which was produced at the trial marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d; J. A. Baba Nona and D. Jane Nona transferred this land to K. M. Soma Tillekaratne Menike by deed no. 8917 dated 26th January 1957, which was produced at the trial marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd04\u201d; K. M. Soma Tillekaratne Menike transferred this land to K. D. Jane Nona by deed no. 101 dated 20th January 1960, which was produced at the trial marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd05\u201d; K. D. Jane Nona gifted this land to her two sons, L. S. Nimal Perera and L. S. Wimal Perera, by deed no. 21580 dated 11th September 1983, which was produced at the trial marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd06\u201d; thus, L. S. Nimal Perera and L. S. Wimal Perera each had an undivided half share of the land; finally, L. S. Wimal Perera transferred his undivided half share of the land to the 1st defendant by deed no. 6958 dated 07th June 1997, which was produced at the trial marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d and L. S. Nimal Perera transferred his undivided half share of the land to the plaintiff by deed no. 8210 dated 14th December 1999, which was produced at the trial marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d; thus, the plaintiff and the 1st defendant jointly own the entirety of the aforesaid land described in the schedule to the plaint - ie: Lots \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d, having a total extent of A:2 R:2 P:26; further, the plaintiff and the 1st defendant and their aforesaid predecessors in title have had undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of the said land for over ten years and, thereby, also have prescriptive title to the entirety of the aforesaid land; the 2nd and 3rd defendants have, wrongfully and without any right or title, disputed the plaintiff\u2019s ownership of the land described in the schedule to the plaint and shown as Lots \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d; the plaintiff pleaded that, in these premises, the plaintiff is entitled to the aforesaid declaration and interim injunction.",

The 1st defendant filed answer associating herself with the averments set out in the plaint and prayed for a declaration of title to a half share of the entire land - ie: a half share of Lots \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d. The 2nd and 3rd defendants filed a joint answer stating that plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d had been prepared for the purposes of D.C. Avissawella Case No. 3204 which had been decided many years previously and claimed that the subject matter of the said Case No. 3204 was only Lot \u201cA\u201d shown on plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d.The 2nd and 3rd defendants put the plaintiff to proof of the title he claimed. The 2nd and 3rd defendants went on to aver that, the 2nd Defendant had title to Lot \u201cB\u201d shown on plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d and that the 3rd Defendant had title to Lot \u201cC\u201d shown on the same plan. With regard to the 2nd defendant\u2019s claim to have title to Lot \u201cB\u201d: the 2nd and 3rd defendants stated that, Lot \u201cB\u201d was a part of the land named Mahawatte alias Kuruwawatta owned by K.W.A. Daniel Singho and others which is shown as the Southern and South Eastern boundary of Lot \u201cB\u201d on plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d. The 2nd and 3rd defendants claim they had possessed and cultivated Lot \u201cB\u201d, for many years, on behalf of K.W.A. Daniel Singho and his wife, I.V. Samichchi Nona and that, subsequently, Samichchi Nona transferred the land named Mahawatte alias Kuruwawatta, including Lot \u201cB\u201d, to the 2nd defendant by deed no. 978 dated 23rd January 1980, which was produced at the trial marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd2 1\u201d. The 2nd and 3rd defendants also stated that, Lot \u201cB\u201d is known as the \u201cPanwila Kumbura\u201d and also as the \u201cKuruwawatta Kumbura\u201d of the land named Mahawatta; With regard to the 3rd defendant\u2019s claim to have title to Lot \u201cC\u201d: the 2nd and 3rd defendants stated that, Lot \u201cC\u201d was a part of the land named Baduwatta alias Miskin\u2019s land owned by K.W.A. Daniel Singho and others which is shown as the North Western boundary of Lot \u201cA\u201d on plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d. The 2nd and 3rd defendants claim that, they had possessed and cultivated Lot \u201cC\u201d, for many years, on behalf of the aforesaid Daniel Singho and his wife, Samichchi Nona and that, subsequently, Samichchi Nona had transferred Lot \u201cC\u201d to the 3rd defendant by deed no. 1248 dated 16th November 1980. The 2nd and 3rd defendants also stated that, Lot \u201cC\u201d is known as the \u201cHitina Watta\u201d of the land named Baduwatta alias Miskin\u2019s land.

    "text": "It should be mentioned here that, although, the 2nd and 3rd defendants prayed, in their answer, for declarations of title to Lots \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d shown on plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d, their answer does not describe these two specific portions of land by specifying their metes and bounds. A plan of these two portions of land was not annexed to the answer, either. Thus, the answer does not comply with the requirement set out in section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code that, where a party to an action claims a specific portion of land, that portion of land must be described \u201cso far as possible by reference to physical metes and bounds, or by reference to a sufficient sketch, map, or plan to be appended to the plaint, and not by name only.\u201d. When the trial commenced, the parties framed issues in line with the averments in their pleadings. Thereafter, the plaintiff gave evidence and produced the documents marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd015\u201d. The plaintiff also led the evidence of three other witnesses - namely, an Officer from the Agrarian Services Centre in Ruwanwella, one A.L. Gunaratne and the plaintiff\u2019s brother. The 1st defendant did not give evidence and associated herself with the plaintiff\u2019s case. When the 2nd and 3rd defendant\u2019s case commenced, the 2nd defendant did not give evidence. Only the 3rd defendant gave evidence. He produced only the deed no. 978 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d. The plaintiff had earlier produced a copy of this deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd011\u201d. Since the determination of this appeal will turn on the evidence placed before Court by the parties, it is necessary to set out the evidence, in some detail. The plaintiff stated that he lives in the village of Kadadara, where the land which is the subject matter of the action is situated. He said this land is named \u201cAswedduma Kumbura together with the Pillewa\u201d and is also named \u201cTalduwage Deniya\u201d and is shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d. The plan no. 1557/L of the same land which was prepared by the Court Commissioner for the purposes of the present action was marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd02\u201d and the Court Commissioner\u2019s Report was marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd02\u0d85\u201d. It is evident that, both plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d and plan no. 1557/L marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd02\u201d, show the same land. The plaintiff stated that, the original owner of the land was R.A.P. Ranasinghe. The plaintiff then produced the aforesaid deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d and traced the chain of title he relies on: commencing from deed no. 976 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d by which R.A.P. Ranasinghe transferred the land to J.A. Baba Nona and D. Jane Nona and ending with deed no.s 6958 and 8210 and marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d and \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d by which L.S. Wimal Perera and L.S. Nimal Perera transferred their undivided half shares of the land to the 1st defendant and plaintiff. The deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d, which constitute the chain of title relied on by the plaintiff, were produced without any objection by the 2nd and 3rd defendants and were duly proved. The plaintiff stated that, from 1994 onwards, he had cultivated the entire land which is the subject matter of this action, on behalf of L.S. Nimal Perera and L.S. Wimal Perera who were the owners of the entire land at that time. Later, the plaintiff and his sister -",

The plaintiff said that, before purchasing the land described in the schedule to the plaint, he checked the boundaries of the land and was satisfied that its total extent was A:2 R:2 P:26. The plaintiff produced, marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd09\u201d, the receipt issued to the plaintiff for the payment of Acreage Levy [\u201c\u0d85\u0d9a\u0dca\u0d9a\u0dbb \u0db6\u0daf\u0dd4\u201d] for the years 1997-1999 on account of the paddy field named \u201cTalduwage Deniya\u201d. This receipt establishes that, the Agrarian Services Centre had recorded the extent of this paddy field as being A:2 R:2 P:26. The plaintiff stated that, on 03rd May 2000, the 2nd and 3rd defendant had disputed the plaintiff\u2019s possession and ownership of Lots \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d and claimed ownership of these Lots \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d. The plaintiff had then lodged the complaint, marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd010\u201d, at the Ruwanwella Police Station. Thereafter, the plaintiff produced, marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd011\u201d, a copy of deed no. 978 referred to in the 2nd and 3rd defendants answer and under and in terms of which, the 2nd defendant claims he has title to Lot \u201cB\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d. The plaintiff stated that, the land claimed by the 2nd defendant under this deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd011\u201d is described in Item 5 of the schedule to this deed as the land named \u201cPanwila Kumbura\u201d which is part of the land named Mahawatta. The plaintiff contended that, Item 5 of that schedule makes it clear that, this land claimed by the 2nd defendant is not Lot \u201cB\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d since Item 5 of the schedule states that the land named \u201cTalduwage Deniya\u201d [which is Lot \u201cB\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d] is the Northern boundary of the 2nd defendant\u2019s land named \u201cPanwila Kumbura\u201d described in Item 5 of the schedule to the deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd011\u201d. The plaintiff contended that, thus, the 2nd defendant\u2019s own deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd011\u201d shows that, the land named \u201cPanwila Kumbura\u201d claimed by the 2nd defendant under that deed and Lot \u201cB\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d claimed by the plaintiff, are two different and separate lands. The plaintiff then produced, marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd012\u201d and \u201c\u0db4\u0dd013\u201d, copies of deed no.s 33291 and 1864 to lands which constitute other boundaries of the plaintiff\u2019s land shown as Lots \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d. Next, the plaintiff produced, marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd014\u201d, a certified extract of the entries made in the Agrarian Services Land Register maintained at the Agrarian Services Centre in Ruwanwella. This entry is in respect of the paddy field named \u201cTalduwage Deniya\u201d also named \u201cAswedduma Kumbura\u201d which is stated to be A:2 R:2 P:25 in extent. The entry states that the Owner/Landlord of the paddy field is L. S. Perera and that the Tenant Cultivator of that paddy field is D. Piyasena.

During cross examination, the plaintiff emphasized that, from 1994 onwards, he cultivated the entirety of the land which is the subject matter of this action - ie: Lots \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d - and that the 2nd and 3rd defendants have never had possession of any part of that land. When learned counsel for the 2nd and 3rd defendants suggested to the plaintiff that he did not have title to Lots \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d, the plaintiff rejected that suggestion and reiterated that he had title by virtue of purchase of the land under and in terms of the deeds produced by him and by long possession and enjoyment of the land \u2013 \u201c\u0db8\u0db8 \u0d91\u0db8 \u0db1\u0dba\u0ddd\u0da2\u0db1\u0dcf\u0dc0 \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dad\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dc2\u0dda\u0dd9 \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf. \u0daf\u0dd3\u0dbb\u0dca\u0d9d \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd3\u0db1 \u0db7\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dad\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc3\u0dc4 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0db3\u0dd3\u0db1\u0db8\u0db1\u0dca \u0dc3\u0dc4 \u0db8\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0daf\u0dd3 \u0d94\u0db4\u0dca\u0db4\u0dd4 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0da7 \u0db8\u0da7 \u0d85\u0dba\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0db8\u0dca \u0d87\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dca \u0dad\u0dd2\u0db1\u0db6\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0db8\u0db8 \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dad\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dcf.\u201d After the plaintiff concluded his evidence, the plaintiff called an Officer from the Agrarian Services Centre in Ruwanwella.

The 3rd defendant claimed that, under and in terms of deed no. 978 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d/ \u201c\u0db4\u0dd011\u201d, the 2nd defendant has title to Lot \u201cB\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d. The 3rd defendant did not produce the other deed no. 1248 referred to in the answer of the 2nd and 3rd defendants, by which the 3rd defendant had claimed to have title to Lot \u201cC\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d. In cross examination, the 3rd defendant admitted that the plaintiff has title to Lot \u201cA\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d. In cross examination, the 3rd defendant also admitted that, K. M. Soma Tillekaratne Menike, who is one of the persons who owned the land in the chain of title relied on by the plaintiff, had title to the land at some time. The 3rd defendant limited the claims of the 2nd and 3rd defendants to Lots \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d. The 3rd defendant went on to state that, he is claiming title only to the land named \u201cHitinawatta\u201d and that the 2nd defendant is entitled to the land named \u201cKuruwawatta\u201d. The aforesaid evidence makes it clear that, there is no dispute between the parties with regard to the plaintiff\u2019s and 1st defendant\u2019s joint ownership of Lot \u201cA\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d. The only dispute between the parties is regarding the ownership of Lots \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d. As set out above, the plaintiff and the 1st defendant claim joint ownership of Lots \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d under and in terms of the chain of title set out in the deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d and by prescriptive title. On the other hand, the 2nd defendant claims ownership of Lot \u201cB\u201d under and in terms of the deed marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d/\u201c\u0db4\u0dd011\u201d on the basis that the land named \u201cPanwila Kumbura\u201d described in deed marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d/\u201c\u0db4\u0dd011\u201d is the same land described as \u201cLot B\u201d in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d. The 2nd defendant also claims to have prescriptive title to Lot \u201cB\u201d. The 3rd defendant has not produced any deed to support his claim to Lot \u201cC\u201d and has not given evidence. In his judgment, the learned District Judge carefully analysed the cases presented to the Court by the plaintiff and the 2nd and 3rd defendants and the evidence that was placed before the Court. Having done so, the learned judge held that, the corpus",

The learned judge further observed that, the deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd011\u201d, \u201c\u0db4\u0dd012\u201dand \u201c\u0db4\u0dd013\u201d confirm that the boundaries of the land claimed by the plaintiff under and in terms of the deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d are the same as the boundaries of the corpus depicted as Lots \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d and the land shown in the later plan no. 1577/1 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd02\u201d. Thus, the learned trial judge held that, the plaintiff has proved the identity of the corpus of the land claimed in this action and proved that, this was the land described in the deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d relied on by the plaintiff to establish his title. The learned District Judge also held that, the plaintiff had duly proved these deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d. Accordingly, the learned District Judge determined that the plaintiff had proved his title to the land which is the subject matter of this action. The learned trial judge went on to hold that, the extract marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd014\u201d established that the land claimed by the plaintiff in this action was registered as a single unit of land in the register maintained by the Agrarian Services Centre and that the the extract marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd015\u201d shows that, the land claimed by the 2nd defendant is a different and separate land. Thereafter, the learned judge held that the evidence established that, from 1994 onwards, the plaintiff had cultivated the land which is the subject matter of this action and that, the extract marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd014\u201d proved that, prior to 1994, the land had been possessed and enjoyed by L. S. Perera, who was the father of L.S. Nimal Perera and L.S. Wimal Perera. The learned judge held that, the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s brother corroborated the position that the plaintiff\u2019s immediate predecessors in title had possessed and enjoyed the land before the plaintiff commenced cultivating the land on their behalf, in 1994. On the aforesaid basis, the learned District Judge held that, the plaintiff had also established prescriptive title to the land. Finally, the learned trial judge held that, an examination of deed no. 978 marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd21\u201d/\u201c\u0db4\u0dd011\u201d relied on by the 2nd and 3rd defendants to establish the 2nd defendant\u2019s title to Lot \u201cB\u201d shown in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d, showed that, the land referred to in that deed was different and separate to the land which is the subject matter of this action. The learned judge observed that, the 2nd and 3rd defendants had led no other evidence to support their claim that they had possessed the land which is the subject matter of this action or that they have title to that land. Accordingly, the District Court entered judgment for the plaintiff as prayed for in the plaint and dismissed the 2nd and 3rd defendants\u2019 claim in reconvention.",

It should be mentioned here that the handwriting on the copy of the judgment has faded and several sections of the judgment are indecipherable. The High Court set aside the judgment of the District Court and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action holding that the plaintiff had failed to prove title upon the deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d which the plaintiff relied on and also holding that the plaintiff had failed to establish prescriptive title. The learned High Court Judges did not enter judgment in favour of the 2nd and 3rd defendants since they held that the 2nd and 3rd defendants had failed to prove title to the lands claimed by them.

    "text": "In this regard, firstly, the learned High Court Judges have formed the erroneous view that, deed no. 976 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d, which is the stem from which the plaintiff claims his title, states that the transferor - R.A.P. Ranasinghe - acquired title to the land by the decree entered in D.C. Avissawella Case No. 3204 and by prescription. That is an error since the deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d makes no reference to R.A.P. Ranasinghe acquiring title by prescription. What this deed does state is that, R.A.P. Ranasinghe acquired title \u201cby inheritance from my father R.W. Mudiyanse upon Deed of Transfer No. 13387 dated 19th May 1927 attested by C.P.D.S. Senanayaka Notary Public of Ruwanwella and upon decree entered in case no. 3204 of the District Court of Avissawella.\u201d. Having misread the deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d, the High Court held that, R.A.P. Ranasinghe could not have acquired prescriptive title because less than ten years had passed between the time when the decree marked \u201cX\u201d dismissing D.C. Avissawella Case No. 3204 was entered and the day on which deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d was executed. This was clearly an error because the deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d placed no reliance on R.A.P. Ranasinghe having prescriptive title. Secondly, it has to be considered whether the evidence before the Court showed that, the plaintiff and his predecessors in title had undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of the land for more than ten years prior to the plaintiff instituting this action on 15th May 2000. In this regard, it is seen that, the learned High Court Judges have decided to disregard the extract marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd014\u201d from the Agrarian Services Land Register because the learned judges thought this extract relates to the year 2000 (which is the year this action was instituted) and also because the learned judges decided that L.S. Perera, who is named as the Owner/Landlord of the land in \u201c\u0db4\u0dd014\u201d, has no connection to the plaintiff\u2019s chain of title. The learned judges erred on both counts. As stated earlier, the Officer from the Agrarian Services Centre had testified that \u201c\u0db4\u0dd014\u201d is an extract of the entries made in the Agrarian Services Land Register for the year 1984 - ie: 16 years before this action commenced. Further, there was clear evidence that, L.S. Perera was the father of L.S. Nimal Perera and L.S. Wimal Perera who are the immediate predecessors in title of the plaintiff and the 1st defendant. Further, as mentioned earlier, the extract marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd014\u201d records that, L.S. Perera possessed the entirety of the paddy field named \u201cTalduwage Deniya\u201d also named \u201cAswedduma Kumbura\u201d which is A:2 R:2 P:26 in extent \u2013 ie: the very same land claimed by the plaintiff and described in the plaint as Lots \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d in Plan No. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d. The learned High Court Judges also failed to realise that, the extract marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd014\u201d proves that, the Agrarian Services Centre had specifically recorded that, this land is one paddy field and not three separate lands. In this regard, it is also relevant to mention that, deed no. 21580 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd06\u201d reveals that, when K.D. Jane Nona gifted that land to her two sons, L.S. Nimal Perera and L.S. Wimal Perera, they were living in Dehiwela and in France, respectively. That would explain why their father is named in the extract marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd014\u201d as owning and possessing the land. Thus, when all these facts are taken together, the extract marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd014\u201d constitutes cogent evidence which",

Further, the learned High Court Judges appear to have disregarded the fact that, the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s brother who stated that, from 1989 onwards - which is more than 10 years before the action was instituted - he was aware that L.S. Nimal Perera and L.S. Wimal Perera possessed the land and that, in 1994, the plaintiff commenced cultivating the land on their behalf, was not challenged in cross examination. Thus, there was clear evidence before the Court to establish that, the plaintiff and his predecessors in title had possession of the land from, at least, 1984 onwards, which is 16 years before this action was instituted. Further, the deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d relied on by the plaintiff to prove his title - which demonstrate an unbroken chain of title stretching back to 1952, which is 48 years before this action was instituted - all state that, the transferors named therein have had possession of the entirety of the land shown as Lots \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d and that this possession has come to the plaintiff and the 1st defendant. In the face of this evidence, the 2nd and 3rd defendants were unable to adduce any evidence to contradict the plaintiff\u2019s claim that he and his predecessors in title had exclusive possession of the entire land upon the title set out in the deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d. The 2nd and 3rd defendants were also unable to adduce any evidence to even suggest that, the possession of the plaintiff and his predecessors in title had been disturbed or interrupted in any manner whatsoever until the incident on 03rd May 2000 which led to the plaintiff filing this action a few days later. In these circumstances, the learned trial judge, who had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses, held that the plaintiff had proved prescriptive title. I cannot see aside that determination by the trial judge. Further, as observed earlier, the learned High Court Judges erred gravely when they disregarded the valuable evidence presented by the extract marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd014\u201d. Accordingly, questions of law no.s (i) and (iii) are answered in the affirmative. Question of law no. (ii) asks whether the learned High Court Judges erred when they held than, the plaintiff\u2019s action had to fail because the plaintiff is claiming title to a bigger land than the land which is the subject matter of the decree entered in D. C. Avissawella Case No. 3204. The learned High Court Judges erred when they reached that conclusion because the extent of the land which was the subject matter of D.C.Avissawella Case No.3204 was not known. Further, the learned High Court Judges mistakenly assumed that, the deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d establishes that the plaintiff relies solely on the decree marked \u201cX\u201d to vest his predecessors with title to the land. In doing so, the learned judges overlooked the fact that, the deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d clearly states that, R.A.P. Ranasinghe\u2019s title to the land derives from paternal inheritance upon deed of transfer No. 13387 in addition",

It is exactly that same extent of land, with the very same boundaries described in the original deed no. 976 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d, which has been passed on to the plaintiff and the 1st defendant by the later deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd04\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d relied on by the plaintiff to prove his title. Therefore, the plaintiff was certainly not claiming a bigger land than he was entitled to under and in terms of his chain of title. Therefore, question of law no. (ii) is also answered in the affirmative. As a result of the aforesaid determination of the three questions of law which are before us, the judgment of the High Court has to be set aside and the judgment of the District Court has to be restored. Before concluding, I would also like to advert to the learned High Court Judges\u2019 determination that the plaintiff had failed to prove title upon the deeds relied on by the plaintiff. A perusal of the judgment shows that the learned judges reached this conclusion because they mistakenly thought the deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d establishes that the plaintiff relied solely on the decree marked \u201cX\u201d to vest his predecessors with title to the land. The learned judges then went on to hold that, the plaintiff could not do so because the decree marked \u201cX\u201d showed that, D.C. Avissawella Case No.3204 had been dismissed and, therefore, no title could flow to any party from that decree. In this regard, the learned judges stated, \u201cIn the circumstances now the issue in hand is to determine whether the Plaintiff Predecessor in title namely R.A.P. Ranasinghe got the title to the entire land on the decree of the case bearing no. 3204. In my view it cannot be happened because the case has been dismissed.\u201d. The High Court erred in this process of reasoning, Firstly, as mentioned earlier, the learned judges overlooked the fact that, the deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d states that, R.A.P. Ranasinghe\u2019s title to the land derives from paternal inheritance upon deed of transfer No. 13387 in addition to the decree in D. C. Avissawella Case No. 3204. Thereafter, the learned judges wrongly assumed that D. C. Avissawella Case No. 3204 was a Partition Case and held that no party can claim any title based on a decree which dismisses a Partition Case. Perhaps in arriving at this assumption, the learned judges relied on factual misrepresentations made in the Written Submissions dated 28th April 2014 filed on behalf of the 2nd and 3rd defendants which submitted that, D.C. Avissawella Case No. 3204 was a Partition Case and that, Plan No. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d was a Partition Plan and the submission that, \u201cThe decree marked as `X\u2019 clearly",

    "text": "states that the case was dismissed. When a partition case is dismissed there are no new rights that accrue from it.\u201d. [emphasis added by me] But, a glance at the decree and the marked \u201cX\u201d and the sections of the handwritten judgment which can be read, would have shown that, D.C. Avissawella Case No. 3204 was an action instituted by one Adasi Gamarallalage Peiris Appuhamy for a declaration of title to a land and that the decree marked \u201cX\u201d only states that, the plaintiff\u2019s action has been dismissed with costs. Therefore, all that could be safely concluded from the decree and judgment is that, the plaintiff in that case \u2013 ie: Adasi Gamarallalage Peiris Appuhamy - cannot claim title under the decree marked \u201cX\u201d. Any rights which the defendants in that case may have claimed to the land, would have remained undisturbed by the decree marked \u201cX\u201d. Therefore, if the aforesaid reference in the deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d was to R.A.P. Ranasinghe deriving a part of his rights to the land from any rights held by the defendants in D.C.Avissawella Case No. 3204, the decree marked \u201cX\u201d would establish that those rights remained undisturbed by the claims made by the plaintiff in that action. However, nothing further can be determined from the decree and judgment marked \u201cX\u201d. But, what does remain certain is that, the High Court erred when it held that, the decree marked \u201cX\u201d ex facie disproved the plaintiff\u2019s title flowing from the deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d. In any event, as mentioned earlier, the duly proved deeds marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd03\u201d to \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d show an unbroken chain of title, stretching over 48 years, by which the entirety of the land shown as Lots \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d in plan no. 329 marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd01\u201d eventually passed to the plaintiff and the 1st defendant. In fact, as set out earlier, in cross examination, the 3rd defendant admitted that, K.M. Soma Tillekaratne Menike who obtained the land under the deed marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 4\u201d, had title to the land at some point. The 2nd and 3rd defendants did not produce any deed which disputes the plaintiff\u2019s title. Further, as mentioned earlier, the evidence shows that the plaintiff and his predecessors in title had possession of the entire land. In these circumstances, it appears that, the learned High Court judges erred when they held that the plaintiff failed to prove title to the land. However, this issue need not be examined further since there is no question of law to be decided on this issue and since any injustice which might have been caused to the plaintiff by such an error on the part of the High Court, has been prevented as a result of the aforesaid determination of the questions of law which are before us.",
