Aluwihare PC. J.,

The Plaintiff-Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter the “Plaintiff”) filed action

bearing No. L/ 325 in the Distract Court of Killinochchi by the plaint dated 02nd

December 2013 against the seven Defendants-Respondent-Petitioners

(Hereinafter the “Defendants”). The matter was supported for enjoining order on

09. 12. 2013. The learned District Judge issued the enjoining order, notice of

interim injunction and summons returnable on 8th January 2014. When the case

was called on 08th January 2014, the Court was informed that summons had not

been served on the Defendants and fresh summons were issued returnable on 28th

February 2014.

It is worth underlining that the Killinochchi Court was re-established around 2010

after the civil conflict. The legal practice was only gradually returning to normalcy

and they were grappling with a scarcity of lawyers who regularly practice in that

Court. Legal practitioners had been forced to resort to ad hoc arrangements in

order to keep the system functioning and to address the scarcity of resources. This

factual reality savours of peculiarity. I consider it important to pay due attention

to these circumstances as they are certainly not factors that can be ignored from

the perspective of demand for Justice.

The Defendants received notices and summons on 24th February 2018 and

appointed Mr. T. Kangatharan as their Attorney at Law. The proxy was filed on

25th February 2018—three days before the next court date. As it transpired, Mr.

Kangatharan was unable to attend the Killinochchi District Court on 28th February

2018 as he had to appear in District Court of Mulaithvu for a trial. He therefore

requested Mr. Sivabalasubramanium Attorney at law, who was one of the few

permanent practitioners in the Killinochchi Court to appear for the Defendants

and move for a date to file the statement of objections and Answers.

In a very peculiar turn of events, however, the Permanent District Judge had to

take leave on 28th February 2018 and he nominated Mr. Sivabalasubramanium to

be the acting District Judge for that day. This left the Defendants with no legal

representation on the 28th February 2014. Nevertheless, the 1st, 2nd and 7th

Defendants had been present in Court and when the case was called, Mr.

Sivabalasubramanium—who was supposed to represent the Defendants on that

day but had to later take up the functions of the Acting Judge—requested one Ms.

Aboobucker present in the Court to make the application on behalf of the

Defendants to move for a date to file statements of objections and Answer. But for

unexplained reasons, the fact that such an application was made is not reflected in

the Journal entry.

On the said day, the Counsel for the Plaintiff wanted to move for an ex-parte trial

against the Defendants who were not present on that day; namely the 3rd to 6th

Defendants.

8

The Acting District Judge declined to make an order fixing the case for ex-parte.

Instead, he informed that the Plaintiff should make the application before the

Permanent District Judge and fixed the case for 27th March 2014.

Soon after, on 05th March 2014, the Plaintiff filed a motion and had the case called

on the same day to support for interim relief. No notice was issued to the 1st, 2nd

and 7th Defendants who were present in Court on the previous day; i.e. 28th

February 2014. The Counsel for the plaintiff, inter alia, also moved the Court to

support an application for the ex-parte trial. On the said day, the learned District

Judge (who was not the presiding judge on 28. 02. 2014) allowed interim relief

and ordered that the case should proceed ex-parte against all defendants.

Upon learning of the new development, the 1st, 2nd and 7th Defendants filed a

motion on 10th March 2014 to vacate the ex-parte order and interim relief. It was

also brought to the attention of the learned District Judge that on the 28th February

2014, the Counsel for the plaintiff only sought to proceed ex-parte against the

absent defendants, and that the Counsel for the plaintiff ought to have given notice

to the 1st, 2nd and 7th Defendants before supporting it for an ex-parte order on 5th

March 2014. The Defendants also contended that the order on the 5th of March

2014 had been made without hearing the other party, and was made per incuriam.

After considering the submission, the learned District Judge vacated the order he

made on the 5th March 2014, allowing interim relief and fixing the matter ex-

parte.

On 27th March 2014, the day on which the case was originally fixed to be called,

the Plaintiff sought permission to move the High Court of Civil Appeal by way of

leave to appeal against the order. However, it was revealed that even at that point,

the plaintiff had already filed the petition of appeal in the High Court. On 31st

March 2015 the High Court allowed the appeal and overturned the order of the

learned District Judge vacating the ex-parte trial on 10th March 2014.

9

The parties have come before this Court impugning the said High Court order.

Leave to proceed has been granted on the following questions of law;

i. Did the District Court without jurisdiction, in violation of the

principles of natural justice and without considering the longstanding

legal principles established by the Judgments of the Superior Courts,

decide to proceed ex-parte against the Defendants and issued interim

injunction against all the Defendants

ii. Was the Order dated 05. 03. 2014, made in breach of the principles

of natural justice, without notice to the other party and without

considering the Judgments of the Superior Courts and hence, the said

Order is per incuriam order.

iii. When the per incuriam nature of the Order dated 05. 03. 2014 was

brought to the notice of the Learned District Judge on 10. 03. 2014,

did the Learned District Judge correctly reverse the said order.

Both in the High Court and in the hearing before this Court, the Plaintiff submitted

that the Defendants’ remedy against an ex-parte order lied in Section 86 (2) of the

Civil Procedure Code and that the District Judge was in error when he vacated the

order invoking the Court’s inherent powers under Section 839 of the Civil

Procedure Code. It was further submitted that the Defendant had failed to make an

application under the said Section 86 (2) and that in terms of Section 86 (2A),

where the ex-parte decree has not yet been served on the defaulting party, the

Court cannot set aside the ex-parte order without the consent of the plaintiff.

10

The Plaintiff placed great reliance on the Court of Appeal decision in Wijesekara v

Wijesekara 2005 1 SLR 58, where it has been held;

(i) Under section 86(2A) it is only if the plaintiff consents and not otherwise

the court can set aside an order made fixing a case for ex-parte hearing

against a defendant.

(ii) An ex-parte order made in default of appearance of a party cannot be

vacated until he makes an application under section 86(2) and purges

the default.

(iii) A court cannot override the express provisions of the Code.

(iv) It is only in cases where no specific rule exists the court has the power to

act according to equity, justice and good conscience.

On the other hand, the defendants alleged that the order fixing the trial to be heard

ex-parte was made per incuriam. They contend that on 28th February, the 1st, 2nd

and 7th Defendants were present in Court and represented by Ms. Aboobakar who

made an application to move for time to file answer and objections. On that day, it

was only agreed that the Plaintiff would move for an ex-parte trial against the

absent defendants, and that in any event, no Order was made by the Acting District

Judge in that regard. Therefore, on 5th March 2014, when the Counsel for the

plaintiff filed a motion and supported the case for interim relief and the application

for an ex-parte trial, he ought to have given notices to the three Defendants. They

further submitted that the order fixing an ex-parte trial against all defendants was

palpably wrong as the 1st, 2nd and 7th Defendants were clearly present in Court on

the said day.

In their Order, the learned High Court Judges have taken up the position that,

11

“However, the case record bears no evidence in proof of appearance of any

attorney at law for the defendants or any application being made for the

defendants to file the answer. Unfortunately, the journal entry of 28th February

2015 does not show any minute about filing of proxy in advance. These are facts

which have to be elicited at a formal inquiry in order to rule out that there had not

been any default on the part of defendant in terms of section 84 of the civil

procedure code. Until and unless a formal inquiry is held in pursuant to an

application under section 86 (2) at the appropriate forum, it cannot be prejudged

on the strength of mere submissions made by Counsel for parties, whether there

was in fact a default on the part of the defendants or an error was committed by

the learned district judge […] ”

We have before us a translation of the Journal entry for 28th February 2014. I

reproduce in verbatim the said journal entry for the sake of clarity;

Attorney at Law Sunthareswara Sharma with Attorney at Law Mahinda

for an Ex-parte trial against the Defendants who are absent and an interim

injunction before the permanent judge.

To be called on: 27. 03. 2014

Accordingly, it is clear that on 28.02.2014, three of the seven Defendants were

present in Court. There is however no trace of any application being made by an

attorney on behalf of the defendants. However, the journal entry also indicates that

the counsel for the plaintiff has intended to make an application for an ex-parte

trial against the “Defendants who are absent”. And the case was to be called on

27th March 2014.

Two factors emanate from this journal entry:

13

1. The plaintiff disclosed in Court, the intention to file an ex-parte application

only against the defendants who were absent.

2. the case was called on that day to file the Defendants’ answer; i.e. 27th March

2014.

These two factors are important to determine the validity of the learned District

Judge’s order made on 05th March 2014 and 10th March 2014.

The translation of the application made by the Counsel for the plaintiff on 5th

March 2014 and the order made by the learned District Judge is before us. And it

appears that in his submission, the learned Counsel for the plaintiff has informed

the Court that on the last occasion, the case was fixed for filing of the Defendants’

answer and that summons have been served accordingly. However, in the same

application, the counsel has stated “Nevertheless, the one to seven Defendants had

not made any attempt to appear before the Court when the case was called again

on 28. 02. 2014 in order to make objection and to file the answer”

It hardly needs to be stated that the above statement was palpably false. The journal

entry clearly bears out that the 1st , 2nd and 7th Defendants were present on that

day. And it was in their presence that the Counsel for the plaintiff informed the

Court that he wished to file an ex-parte application against defendants who were

absent on that day. In any event, no Order was made by the Acting Judge and a

further one-month-time was given. The 1st, 2nd and 7th Defendants left the Court

house that day on the assurance that an ex-parte application would not be made

till the 27th of March 2014.

However, it must be noted that the learned District Judge allowed the application

on 5th march 2014 made by the Plaintiff not on the basis of default of appearance

of the Defendants but the failure to file the Answer and Objections. He has also

14

noted that contrary to what was stated by the Counsel for the Plaintiff, the 1st, 2nd

and 7th Defendants had been present in Court on that day.

“But it was reported in the proceeding that when the case was taken on 28. 02.

2014, the 1st, 2nd and 7th Defendants were present. In addition, the Court considers

that all Defendants had appointed the Attorney by Attorney Appointment dated 25.

02. 2014. As well as it is mentioned in the proceedings that the 1st, 2nd and 7th

Defendants were present, and 3rd, 4th , 5th and 6th Defendants were absent and no

attorneys appeared on behalf of them. The plaintiff’s attorney further made the

application that neither the 1st, 2nd and 7th Defendants nor their Attorney made

any application on behalf of them, and 3rd, 5th , 6th Defendants were absent.”

Thus, the learned District Judge has allowed the application for an ex-parte trial

on the basis of failure to file the answer and objection of the Defendants. He had

observed that an Attorney at Law had been appointed by the Defendants and that

no representation had been made on that day to get further time.

I pause at this point to state that the learned District Judge was too quick to draw

an adverse inference against the Defendants who were present on that day. The

proxy for the appointment of an Attorney at Law was only filed on the 25th of

February 2014—three days before the summons returnable date. Barring the

peculiar events that took place on the 28th February 2014, the Defendants would

not have had adequate time to file statement of objections and their Answer.

In any event, under section 84 of the Civil Procedure Code, the Judge has the

discretion to grant further time, to file answers.

In Dharmasena and another v The People’s Bank (2003) 1 SLR 122 the Supreme

Court held that;

“The Code must be interpreted, as far as possible, in consonance

with the principles of natural justice, and the court can only be

15

satisfied that summons has been "duly" served where the Defendant

has been given a fair opportunity of presenting his case in his answer.

If not, the court has the power to give further time for answer even if

the Defendant does not ask...”

It is quite clear that no order was made in respect of the ex-parte application on

28th February 2018. If, as contended by the Plaintiff, there was a clear failure on

the part of the Defendants to file the answer, the acting District Judge would not

have had any difficulty in making that order on the same day. Instead, he decided

to call the case on 27th March 2018, in a months-time. Reasons for this are

unknown-it could have been that the acting District Judge being privy to the

peculiar circumstances granted further time; or it could be that he did not

personally wish to make that order and thought it best left to the Permanent Judge.

Whatever be the reasons that suggested to the acting judge, there was an order

sanctioned by the court to call the case on 27th March 2017. In those

circumstances, the plaintiff had the obligation to inform the 1st, 2nd and 7th

Defendants when he filed the motion on 05th March 2017 and move for an ex-

parte trial. A counsel cannot whimsically change the undertakings he gives in

court for his benefit.

In ABN-Amro Bank v CONMIX (private) Limited (1996) 1 SLR 08 a five judge

bench determined that;

“section 84 requires the Court "to hear the case ex parte forthwith,

or on such other day as the Court may fix". Obviously, a decision to

hear the case on same day, must be taken the same day. But a decision

to hear the case on some other day is not required to be taken the

same day; the phrase "as the Court may fix" is not qualified by

"forthwith" or other similar words. Accordingly, I am of the view that

the date for ex parte trial may be fixed by the Court either on the day

16

of the default, or on another day; and with respect, that Ameen v. Raji

must be overruled on that point.

There are practical considerations which confirm this interpretation.

On the summons returnable date it may not be known- for good

reasons, such as illness or absence abroad, when the plaintiff, his

Counsel or an essensial witness would be available, and the Court

may therefore fix a calling date. Again, Ameen v. Raji shows that a

case may come up in the roll Court and, upon the defendant's default,

be sent immediately to the appropriate Court dealing with trials of

that kind, to enable a trial date to be fixed; and it may happen that

when the record reaches that Court, it has already adjourned for the

day. Similar problems may arise when there is an impending change

in the territorial jurisdiction of a Court, or a re-allocation of its work;

or when a Judge is on leave or is due to go on transfer soon; or when

on the day of the defendant's default, the matter comes up before a

Judge who does not wish to deal with it for personal reasons.”

As I remarked, the Counsel who had been retained by the Defendants had to attend

another Court on the same day, and Mr. Sivabalasubramanium who was supposed

to make the application on behalf of his clients, had to function as the acting

District Judge for that day which left the Defendants unattended. Being apprised

of the situation and after giving an undertaking that an application will only be

moved against the absentees, the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff had a duty to

inform the Defendants when he filed the motion on the 5th of March 2014, and

supported the ex-parte application.

17

On the 5th march 2014, it was not the acting judge but the permanent judge who

was presiding and save and except for the scanty journal entry, he was not

personally privy to the incidents and circumstances that prevailed on 28th March

2014. Therefore, there was greater onus on the part of the plaintiff to apprise the

Court of the true circumstances that transpired on the earlier day. Had the Plaintiff

issued notice on the 1st, 2nd and 7th Defendants, I am certain, that the Judge would

not have penalized the Defendants for purportedly failing to file the Answers as

they could have brought to the attention of the learned District Judge the factors

that prevented them from filing the Answer and the Objections.

This Court has in a series of cases consistently upheld that failure to observe natural

justice goes to the root of the Court’s jurisdiction and renders the proceedings a

nullity.

In Lokumenike v Sinduhamy 34 CLW 102 it was held;

“that where an ex-parte order had been made behind the back of a

party by any court, such court has jurisdiction to entertain and

determine an application by the party affected to vacate such order”

In Ittepana v Hemawathie (1981) 1 SLR 476 the Court held that;

“Jurisdiction naturally divides itself into three heads. In order to the

validity of a judgment, the Court must have jurisdiction of the

persons, of the subject matter and of the particular question which it

assumes to decide. It cannot act upon persons who are not legally

before it; upon one who is not a party to the suit ..... upon a defendant

who has never been notified of the proceedings. If the Court has no

jurisdiction, it is of no consequence that the proceedings had been

formally conducted, for they are coram non judice. A judgment

18

entered by such Court is void and a mere nullity. (Black on Judgments

- P.261)”

A similar line of thinking has been adopted in Siththi Maleeha and another v Nihal

Ignatius Perera and Others (1994) 3 SLR 270: (Court of Appeal) , The Ceylon

Ceramics Corporation v Premadasa (1984) 2 SLR 250: (Court of Appeal).

The principle is clear; -a fair opportunity must be given to a party before an order

is given by the Court. The fair opportunity could entail a myriad of factors and in

each case, it is up to the Court to decide whether any irregularity prejudicing

natural justice has taken place.

In the present instance, the counsel for the Plaintiff has at first attempted to mislead

the Court by stating that all defendants were absent and thereafter had reiterated

that no application was made on behalf of the defendants on 28. o3. 2014. On the

5th March 2014, the counsel for the plaintiff made the particular application

without notice to 1st, 2nd and 7th Defendants despite agreeing on 28th February that

he will only proceed against the absentees. Had he informed the defendants present

on that day, they would have been able to adduce reasons for the purported failure

to move for further time to file the answers.

Accordingly, I answer the 1st and 2nd questions of law in the affirmative.

The next question for determination is whether the learned district judge erred

when he vacated the ex-parte order invoking the inherent powers of the Court, as

oppose to insisting on the procedure under section 86 (2) of the Civil Procedure

Code.

The plaintiff-Respondent strenuously argued that the Defendants ought to have

invoked the jurisdiction under section 86 (2) to vacate the order and that the

learned District Judge erred when he vacated the order resorting to section 839

when the law has provided for a distinct procedure for that purpose.

19

In response, the defendants submitted that the procedure under section 86 (2)

could be invoked when there is a ‘default’ and that there was no such ‘default’ by

the defendants in the present instance as the Plaintiff surreptitiously obtained the

ex-parte order. They have also cited several authorities wherein it has been stated

that the Court has the inherent jurisdiction to remedy a violation of natural justice.

In Carolis Appuhamy v Singho Appu 5 NLR 75, the Court held that;

“As a rule, he has power to open or rescind his own orders made,

not inter partes but ex parte. on being satisfied that the order was

made to the prejudice of a party who was unable to attend in

consequence of illness or other circumstances over which he had

no control.

Such power doubtless must be exercised with caution, and only on

sufficient materials and within a reasonable time after the ex

parte decree or order was made”

Similarly, Albert v Veeriahpillai (1981) 1 SLR 110 elucidates that;

“The authority to vacate an earlier order is attributable to the inherent

jurisdiction of the Tribunal to set aside such order if it had been made

without jurisdiction in as much as the breach of principles of natural

justice goes to jurisdiction and renders an order or determination made

in proceedings of which the person against whom the order or

determination was made has had no notice, void.”

It must be stated that in the aforesaid cases, the question about procedure did not

arise. In contrast, in the present case, the plaintiff’s first line of argument is that

20

the proper procedure for vacation of an ex-parte order is in section 86 (2) and that

the Court could not have resorted to its inherent powers when the law provides for

a procedure.

There is merit in this argument. Section 86 (2) clearly provides a remedy for

Defendants to canvas against an ex-parte order. The wording of section 86 (2)

does not specify that the procedure for vacation excludes certain types of orders—

be it made in violation of natural justice or otherwise. There are no different genres

of ex-parte orders.

“2) Where, within fourteen days of the service of the decree entered

against him for default, the defendant with notice to the plaintiff makes

application to and thereafter satisfies court, that he had reasonable

grounds for such default, the court shall set aside the judgment and decree

and permit the defendant to proceed with his defence as from the stage of

default upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as to the court shall

appear proper”

This was quite clearly explained by Justice Fernando in ABN-Amro Bank v

CONMIX (private) Limited (1996) 1 SLR 08 ;

“If there has been no due service of summons (or due notice), but the

Court nevertheless mistakenly orders an ex-parte trial, then for that

breach of natural justice, section 86 (2) provides a remedy: a defendant's

default can be excused if it is established that there were reasonable

grounds for such default, and one such ground would be the failure to

serve summons. The consequence of non-compliance with natural

justice is not that non-appearance ceases to be a "default", only that,

although that lapse is a "default", yet it is a default for which there are

reasonable grounds, and which therefore can be excused. I am therefore

of the view that the need to comply with natural justice and "default" are

21

two distinct matters; that while the audi alteram partem rule does not

modify or restrict the meaning of "default", breach of that rule affords

an excuse for "default"”

Stripped to essentials, this means that there is only once procedure for vacation of

ex-parte orders—that is to proceed under section 86 (2). This mechanism does not

distinguish between orders given based on different reasons.

Section 839 provides;

“Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect

the inherent power of the court to make such orders as may be

necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of

the court.”

However, this does not mean that a District Judge can disregard the procedure he

is bound to follow. If the time period for the invocation of section 86 (2) procedure

has lapsed or there is a defect not catered to by law, a judge may always invoke the

powers under section 839 to remedy the injustice it may cause to parties. But a

Judge must always be prudent not to flout the procedure he is bound to follow.

Nevertheless, the fact that the present application contains unusual circumstances

cannot be overlooked. Even if the learned District Judge made an error in not

insisting on the procedure, I do not believe that it resulted in any substantial

prejudice or occasioned a failure of justice. The facts are clear: the initial order

allowing the ex-parte trial should not have been made on the 5th March 2014. In

those circumstances, I respectfully disagree with the learned High Court Judges

decision that “Rightly or wrongly the matter has now been fixed for ex-parte trial.

Correctness of the order fixing for ex-parte trial has to be decided at an inquiry to

be held if an application is made at the appropriate stage.”

22

The appeal before them was one that classically called for the application of the

proviso to section 5A of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act as

amended which reads;

“Provided that no judgment or decree of a District Court or of a

Family Court, as the case may be, shall be reversed or varied by the

High Court on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which

has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned

a failure of justice ”

This principles has been approved by Superior courts in several cases; Sunil

Jayarathna v. Attorney General 2011 2 Sri LR 91; Rev. Minuwangoda Dhammika

Thero v. Rev. Galle Saradha Thero 2003 3 Sri LR 247; Madilin Nona And Others

v. Ranasinghe And Others 2012 1 Sri LR 155;Vernon Boteju v. Public Trustee 2001

2 Sri LR 124.

Thus, only in light of the facts and circumstances of the present case, I am of the

view that the learned District Judge did not occasion any failure of justice by

vacating the ex-parte order on 10th March 2014, invoking the inherent

jurisdiction of the Court.

I answer the third question of law in the affirmative.

Considering the above I set aside the order made by the High Court of Civil Appeals

dated 31st March 2015. The order made by the learned District Judge on 10th

March 2014, vacating the order he made on 5th March 2014 in fixing the matter

ex parte, is hereby restored.

Before I conclude, I place on record the dissatisfaction with which I regard the

conduct of the Counsel who represented the Plaintiff before the District Court. It

was no less an effrontery on his part to have misled the Court—to which he owes

an absolute overarching duty. By concealing facts and reneging on his

23

undertaking, he trampled on the rights of the other party and showed a cussed

disregard for professionalism. This Court severely admonishes him for his

reprehensible conduct and strongly advises that he conducts himself more

ethically and responsibly in the future.

Appeal allowed.
