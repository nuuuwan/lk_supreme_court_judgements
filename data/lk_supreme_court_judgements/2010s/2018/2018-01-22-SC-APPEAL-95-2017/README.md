Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant Vs Mahamarakkalage Mahindarathne Kudabolana, Ambalantota. Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent-Respondent Before : Sisira J De Abrew J NalinPerera J Vijith Malalgoda PC J Counsel : Senany Dayartne with Eshanthe Mendis and Nisala Seniya Fernando for the Defendant- Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant Rohan Sahabandu PC with Hasitha Amarasingha Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent-Respondent Argued on : 21.9.2017 Written Submission Tendered on : 27.9.2017 by the Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant. 2.10.2017 by the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent-Respondent. Decided on : 22.1.2018 Sisira J De Abrew J

Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Plaintiff-Respondent) filed an action against his wife to obtain a decree of divorce

on the ground of malicious desertion. The Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner-

3

Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant-Appellant) filed answer

requesting a decree of divorce on the ground of constructive malicious desertion.

She also asked for permanent alimony of Rs.5.0 Million. After trial, the learned

District Judge holding in favour of the Defendant-Appellant granted her the

divorce. He also ordered the Plaintiff-Respondent to pay Rs.18,65000/- as a

permanent alimony to the Defendant-Appellant. Being aggrieved by the amount of

permanent alimony ordered by the learned District Judge, the Plaintiff-Respondent

appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court (hereinafter referred to as the High

Court). The High Court holding that the amount of permanent alimony ordered by

the learned District Judge was highly excessive, reduced it to Rs.700,000/-. Being

aggrieved by the said order of the High Court, Defendant-Appellant has appealed

to this court. This court by its order dated 23.5.2017 granted leave to appeal on

questions of law set out in paragraphs 17(b), (g) and (h) of the Petition of Appeal

dated 24.2.2015 which are set out below.

1. Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law by reducing the alimony from

Rs.18,00000/- to Rs.700,000/- in the circumstances of the case?

2. Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law by failing to take cognizance

of the fact that by reducing the amount of alimony sought for when there

was no objection from the Respondent in relation to the permanent alimony

claimed by the Petitioner?

3. Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law by failing to give reasons in

reducing the quantum of alimony from Rs.18,00000/- to 700,000/-?

The Plaintiff-Respondent is a Government teacher. The learned District

Judge according to the evidence placed before him concluded that the salary of the

4

Plaintiff-Respondent was Rs.23,000/- at the time of filing the action. The learned

District Judge considering the above salary of the Plaintiff-Respondent concluded

that the monthly amount entitled by the Defendant-Appellant was Rs.4625/-. There

is no dispute about this figure. According to the evidence, at the time of filing the

action the Plaintiff-Respondent was 48 years old and the Defendant-Appellant was

34 years old. The learned District Judge concluded that the Defendant-Appellant

was entitled to 30 years of alimony at the rate of Rs.4625/- per month. Thus the

amount ordered by the learned District Judge was (4625x12x30=16,65,000/-

)Rs.16,65,000/-. In addition to the above amount the learned District Judge

concluded that the Plaintiff-Respondent should pay Rs.200,000/- on the basis that

he receives income from his properties. However the learned District Judge in his

judgment observed that although the Defendant-Appellant claimed that the

Plaintiff-Respondent has two acres of paddy land and five acres of coconut land, it

has not been proved. The Plaintiff-Respondent has, in his evidence, stated apart

from the government salary he does not get any other income. He has further stated

that he does not have five acres of coconut. The learned District Judge has

observed in his judgment that the Defendant-Appellant had not proved the amount

of monthly income that the Plaintiff-Respondent receives from his paddy and

coconut lands. Therefore granting the above sum of Rs.200,000/- is, in my view,

wrong and has to be set aside. The learned Judges of the High court in their

judgment have considered most of the matters which I have stated above.

Considering all the above matters I hold that the learned High Court Judges were

correct when they decided to remove Rs.200,000/- from the amount ordered by the

learned District Judge.

The next question that must be decided is whether the amount calculated by

the learned District Judge for 30 years on the basis of Rs.4625/- per month is

5

excessive or not. Learned counsel for the Defendant-Appellant cited the following

judicial decisions.

In Mathew Vs Mathew 57 NLR 511 the Supreme Court held as follows:

“The Court, when granting a decree of separation in favour of a wife, ordered

the husband to pay an annual sum o f R s. 20,400 in monthly instalments of

Rs.1,700. With a view to securing for the wife the payment of the annual

sum of Rs.20,400 the husband was ordered to hypothecate certain

immovable property specified in the decree.

Held, (i) that the order for hypothecation of immovable property did not fall

within the ambit of either sub-section 1 or sub-section 2 of section 615 of the

Civil Procedure Code and could not therefore stand.

(ii) that the order for paying the annual sum of Rs, 20,400 in monthly

instalments did not come within the ambit of sub-section 1 of Section 615 of

the Civil Procedure Code but could be treated as an order falling within the

ambit of sub-section 2.

Held further, that in deciding the amount of permanent alimony no fetter was

imposed by section 615 of the Civil Procedure Code on the discretion of the

Judge. Nor was the Judge bound by the amount awarded as alimony

pendente lite.”

Wijeratne Vs Wijeratne 73 NLR 546 Supreme Court held as follows.

“In an action for divorce, sufficient ground must be shown before the Court

can award as permanent alimony a sum in excess of the amount claimed by

the wife as alimony pendent lite.”

6

The learned District Judge decided to grant permanent alimony for the next

30 years at the rate of Rs.4625/- per month on the basis that the life expectancy in

this country 75 years of age. Can anybody predict the life expectancy of a human

being? No one can answer this question because life is uncertain. In this country

the Judges have departed the world whilst holding office.It has to be stated here

that this situation does not always exist. Court must be reasonable in deciding the

amount of alimony. According to the learned District Judge’s order the Plaintiff-

Respondent should pay alimony for 18 years even after his retirement. The

calculation done by the learned District Judge is, in my view, is unreasonable.

The learned District Judge when calculating the amount of Rs.4625/-,

observed that another sum could be added considering the inflation in the country.

But there is no evidence placed before court regarding the rate of inflation. The

learned District Judge appears to have made the said observation to justify the

ordering of the amount even after retirement of the Plaintiff-Respondent. Although

the Plaintiff-Respondent could earn his salary increments, there is no evidence

before court about his salary increments. When I consider all the above matters, I

feel that it is not reasonable to order the same amount to be paid even after the

retirement of the Plaintiff-Respondent. But the order to pay Rs.4625/- per month

prior to retirement of the Plaintiff-Respondent is, in my view, reasonable. At the

time of filing the action the Plaintiff-Respondent was 48 years old. His retiring age

is 60 years. Therefore the decision to pay alimony for a period of 12 years at the

rate of Rs.4625/- per month (4625x12x12=666,000) is, in my view, reasonable.

Since the Plaintiff-Respondent is a Government servant it is reasonable to conclude

that after retirement he would get a pension of 80% of his salary. Then considering

the amount of Rs.4625/-, the monthly amount after retirement would be

(4625x80/100) Rs.3700/-

7

In my view the conclusion reached by the learned District Judge that the

Plaintiff-Respondent should pay Rs.4625/- per month even after the retirement of

the Plaintiff-Respondent is erroneous. The next question that must be considered is

that the period for which that the Plaintiff-Respondent should pay alimony after his

retirement. As I pointed out earlier no one could predict the life expectancy of a

human being. In my view it is reasonable to order five years of alimony at the rate

of Rs.3700/- per month after the retirement of the Plaintiff-Respondent. This

amount would be (3700x12x5=222,000/-) Rs.222,000/-. Considering all the above

matters, I hold that the Defendant-Appellant would be entitled to receive a

permanent alimony as follows:

4625x12x12= 666,000

3700x12x5=222,000

The total amount would be Rs.888,000/-

The learned High Court Judges have given reasons when they reduced the

amount ordered by the learned District Judge. But in my view the amount ordered

by the learned District Judge cannot be considered to be reasonable.

For the aforementioned reasons, I answer the 1st question of law in

the affirmative, but the 2nd question of law does not arise for consideration. The 3rd

question of law is answered as follows.

“The learned Judges of the High Court did not give sufficient reasons when

they reduced the alimony from 18 lakhs to 700,000.”

I have decided that the Defendant-Appellant is entitled to Rs.888,000/- as a

permanent alimony. The learned District Judge is directed to amend the decree

8

accordingly. Subject to the above variation of the amount of alimony, the appeal of

the Defendant-Appellant is dismissed. Considering the facts of this case I do not

make an order for costs.
