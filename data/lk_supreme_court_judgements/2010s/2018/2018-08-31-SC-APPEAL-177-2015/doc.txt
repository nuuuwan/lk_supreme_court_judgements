Aluwihare PC, J.

This Court granted Special Leave to Appeal on the following questions of law:

1) Did the Court of Appeal err in law in refusing an Application of the

Petitioner for a Writ of Mandamus for a ‘Derequisition order’

derequisitioning the property which was requisitioned for the temporary

use of the 5th Respondent by Requisitioning Order No. 101 dated 24th April

1974 made under Section 10 (1) of the Co-operative Societies (Special

Provisions) Act No. 35 of 1970 published in Government Gazette No. 108/9

of 26th April 1974 and occupied by the 5th Respondent for over 35 years?

2) Did the Court of Appeal err in law in holding that a contract of tenancy

exists between the Petitioner and the 5th Respondent who entered into the

property under and by virtue of the Requisition Order No. 101 dated 24th

April 1974 made under section 10 (1) of the Co-Operative Societies (Special

Provisions) Act No. 35 of 1970, published in Government Gazette No. 108/9

of 26th April 1974, marked “P2”?

3) Did the Court of Appeal err in law in holding that the Petitioner is guilty of

laches, in the circumstances of this matter?

4) Did the Court of Appeal err in law in holding failing to appreciate that the

single judge bench of the Court of Appeal that delivered the impugned

Judgment is bound by the judgment of the Two judge bench of the Court of

Appeal in Case No. C.A. (PHC) 75/2008 Bandarawela Multi-Purpose Co-

operative Society v Periannen Nadaraja and Others (decided on 9th

September 2010) and the Application for Special Leave to Appeal against

which judgment has been refused by the Supreme Court in Application No.

SC. (SPL) L.A. 198/2010 decided on 8th September 2011?

5

5) Did the Court of Appeal err in law holding that the Petitioner has failed to

show that a legal duty is owed to herself by the Respondents, in the

circumstances of this matter?

A brief narration of the facts is as follows.

The Petitioner-Appellants’s (hereinafter “the Petitioner”) predecessor in title

Kanther Sivagurunathan Nadarajah constructed the “Nathan Building” which is

the premises in suit. Before the said Kanther Sivagurunathan Nadarajah could

occupy the said building, the 5th Respondent, Yatiyanthota Multipurpose

Cooperative Societies Limited (hereinafter the Cooperative Society) by a

requisitioning order No. 101 dated 24th April 1974 made for “temporary use”

under section 10 (1) of the Co-Operative Societies Act No. 35 of 1970 published

in Government Gazette No. 108/9 of 26. 04. 1974, came in to occupation of the

property in question. Subsequently, the 5th Respondent Cooperative Society

through the letter marked “AP5” informed the Petitioner’s predecessor in title that

the Department of Cooperative Development had forwarded the necessary

documents to the Chief Valuer in order to assess the monthly compensation for the

requisitioning of the Nathan Building. The letter further informed that the

Petitioner will be paid Rs. 350/= per month as an advance payment of rent. This

amount was later increased to Rs. 400/= per month following the Chief Valuer’s

assessment.

After a reasonable period of ‘temporary use’ by the 5th Respondent, the Petitioner’s

predecessor in title on several occasions requested the 5th Respondent Cooperative

Society to hand over the premises in suit. On 1st August 1992, the Petitioner’s

predecessor in title through a letter (AP 8) requested the 5th Respondent to

derequisition the premises in order to house his business since the family business

6

establishment which up to that point had been conducted in a rented place

elsewhere was burnt down during the riots of 1983 and the owners of those rented

premises had refused to rent out the said premises, once again.

The 5th Respondent Cooperative Society, by writing, dated 8th November 1992,

(AP9), informed the Petitioner’s predecessor in title that the 5th Respondent is in

the process of constructing a new building and that his request would be

considered upon the completion of the said new building. Once the buildings were

constructed, the Petitioner’s predecessor in title again requested the 5th Respondent

to issue a derequisition order pointing out that the said new building had been

completed and that the 5th Respondent Cooperative Society was earning an income

of 8000/= rupees per month by renting out a portion of the Nathan Building to a

third party while paying only 400/=per month to the Petitioner’s predecessor in

title. [AP 10]

Instead, however, of handing over the vacant possession of the premises, the 5th

Respondent Cooperative Society then moved to have the Nathan Building acquired

under the Land Acquisition Act by notice dated 4th January 2001. Thereupon the

Petitioner’s predecessor in title filed CA writ Application bearing No. 324/2001

against the proposed acquisition by Petition marked “AP12”. The Court of Appeal

by judgment dated 19th August 2002 issued a writ of certiorari quashing the said

notice and also issued a writ of prohibition prohibiting the authorities concerned

from taking over the premises under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act.

Pursuant to the said judgement, the Petitioner’s predecessor in title proceeded to

institute legal action to have the property returned to him. However, prior to any

further action being taken, the Petitioner’s predecessor in title passed away.

Once the title to the property in suit had vested in her, the Petitioner by writing

marked “AP22” to “AP26” demanded the 1st to the 5th Respondents to release the

7

property in suit to the Petitioner. The 4th Respondent and the secretary of the 5th

Respondent Cooperative Society by writing (AP27) and (AP28) sought 2 further

weeks to respond to the said letter of the Petitioner. Regrettably, they never replied.

Thereafter the petitioner filed an application for a writ of mandamus in the Court

of Appeal to compel the 1st and 2nd Respondents to derequisition the property on

the basis that the 5th Respondent’s continued occupation of the property

requisitioned for temporary use in 1974 was ultra vires and grossly unreasonable

and illegal viz a viz the provisions of the Cooperative Societies (Special Provisions)

Act no. 35 of 1970.

The Respondents took up the position that the Petitioner’s predecessor in title had

entered into a tenancy agreement with the 5th Respondent Cooperative Society and

that they had a legal right to remain in possession of the Nathan building in their

capacity as a tenant. It was further pointed out that the 5th Respondent was in any

event a tenant protected under the Rent Act and that the Cooperative Societies

(Special Provisions) Act No. 35 of 1970 has been repealed or fallen into disuse. The

Respondents also pointed out that the petitioner’s application was time barred. It

was further contended that the Petitioner was not entitled to seek a writ of

mandamus as the Cooperative Societies Act vests the discretion in the minister, the

1(e) Respondent, to derequisition the property.

The Court of Appeal by a bench of a single judge in the judgment dated 30th

September 2014 refused to issue a writ of mandamus and held that;

There is a valid tenancy agreement between the 5th Respondent and the

Petitioner’s predecessor in title, marked by the Respondents as “R6.” The

petitioner has failed to mention that there has been contract between the

parties for the very reasons that if he did so a writ cannot lie.

8

That the petitioner was guilty of laches in as much as she has moved only

after 34 years to have the property derequisitioned. A writ of mandamus is

a discretionary remedy and cannot be granted even when there is no other

remedy available. And that the petitioner has failed to show that there is a

legal duty owed to the petitioner by the respondents.

It is against the judgement of the Court of Appeal that the Petitioner has come

before this court.

Of the 5 legal questions before us, it is pertinent to proceed to address the 2nd issue;

first, whether there is a separate tenancy agreement between the parties. In my

opinion, if this question is answered in favour of the Respondent, there would be

no necessity to inquire into the other legal issues raised before us.

As mentioned above, the 5th Respondent came to occupy the Nathan Building

following a requisitioning order No. 101 dated 24th April 1974 made under

section 10 (1) of the Co-Operative Societies Act No. 35 of 1970 published in

Government Gazette No. 108/9 of 26. 04. 1974. Section 10 reads; “the Minister

may by order (in this Act referred to as a requisitioning order) published in the

Gazette, requisition, with effect from such date as shall be specified in the order,

any immovable property that it may be temporarily used by a principal society for

the purposes of any business of such society”. According to the document marked

“P2” the then Minister requisitioned the Nathan Building with effect from 8th May

1974 to be used by the Yatiyanthota Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Limited.

It is the contention of the 5th Respondent Cooperative Society, however, that they

possess the Nathan Building not only by virtue of the said Requisitioning Order but

also by virtue of a Tenancy Agreement marked “R6” which the 5th Respondent and

the Petitioner’s predecessor in title had entered into in 1976. The 5th Respondent

9

strenuously argued that “R6” is a tenancy agreement, as it decisively uses the word

“කුලිය (rent)” whereas under the Co-Operative Societies (Special Provisions) Act

No. 35 of 1970 there is no monthly ‘rent’ payable but only “compensation” in

terms of sections 13 to 19 of the Act.

In response, the Petitioner pointed out that the words “rent” and “compensation”

had been used interchangeably and that the word ‘rent’ is in fact a reference to

‘compensation.’ The question that needs to be determined now is whether “R6” is

a Tenancy Agreement that exists independently of the Requisitioning Order issued

on 26. 04. 1974.

On the face of it, it is apparent that “R6” is not a tenancy agreement. Unlike in a

normal tenancy agreement, there is no identification of the corpus, or any clauses

pertaining to handing over the possession of the premises, determining the rights

and liabilities of the parties in relation to the tenancy or the duration for which

tenancy agreement is signed. The document only stipulates that “නාදන්

ග ාඩනැගිල්ගල් ග වල් කුළිය සම්බන්දගයන් එකඟත්වයට පැමිණ 1976-12-15 දින

යටියන්ගතාටදී අත්සන් තබන ලද ගිවිසුම් පත්‍රය” In terms of “R6”, the 5th Respondent

had undertaken to pay a sum of 400/= to the Petitioner’s predecessor in title on a

monthly basis till the Chief Valuer’s Assessment was communicated to them.

Furthermore, “R6” stipulates that any difference in the value that would be

revealed pursuant to the said assessment would be reimbursed by the respective

party. Plainly, “R6” is an agreement that regulates the payment of a sum of money

and a condition pertaining to reimbursement. It cannot by any stretch of the

imagination be construed being anything more than that. If “R6” is deliberately

limited to the payment of rent for the Nathan Building, logically there ought to be

another document which explains the genesis of this arrangement. At this point,

it is helpful to peruse the document “AP 5” which is a letter sent by the 5th

Respondent Cooperative Society to the Petitioner’s predecessor in title. The letter

10

informed that the documents necessary for the calculation of the monthly sum for

the requisitioned property ‘Nathan Building’ had already been sent to the Chief

Valuer and that as there had been some delay in the assessment of the sum, the 5th

Respondent co-operative society had decided to pay Rupees Rs. 350/= to the

Petitioner’s Predecessor in title on a monthly basis. It further stated that;

“එගසේ අත්ිකාරම් මුදල් ග වීගම්දී තකගසේරු කරන ලද මාසික කුළිය ග වනු ලබන

රුපියල් 350/= ට වැඩ වැඩිවුවග ාත් එම හිඟ මුදල සමිිගයන් ග වීමත්, තකගසේරු කරන

ලද මාසික කුළිය රුපියල් 350/=ට වැඩ අඩු වුවග ාත් එම මුදල සමිියට ග වන බවට

ගපාගරාන්ු පත්‍රයකට අත්සන් කිරීගමන් පසුව එම ග වල් කුලී අත්ිකාරම් මුදල ලබා දිය

ැකි බැවින් [...]”

This letter sent in September 1975 in my opinion forms the basis of the agreement

“R6” signed and entered into on 15-12-1976. “R6” therefore was neither a

tenancy agreement nor an agreement that determined the ‘rent.’ It was the

aforementioned “ගපාගරාන්ු පත්‍රය” whereby both parties expressly undertook to

reimburse each other where there was a difference in the amount paid and the

actual amount due for the value of the property.

It is also pertinent to note that “මාසික කුළිය” referred to in “R6” was not a sum

which the parties had agreed mutually. It explicitly states that:

“දැනට ඉ ත සඳ න් ග ාඩනැගිල්ගල්, මාසික කුළිය තකගසේරුකරවා ැනීම සඳ ා අවශ්‍ය

ලියකියවිලි, කෑ ල්ල සමූපකාර සංවර්ධන උප ගකාමසාරිසේ තුමා මඟින් තකගසේරු

ගදපාර්තගම්න්තුව ගවත ඉදිරිපත් කර ඇි බැවින් එකී ග ාඩනැගිල්ල සඳ ා මාසික කුළිය

තකගසේරුකර එවන තුරු, පළමුවන පකෂගයන් ගදවන පකෂයටත් ග ාඩනැගිල්ගල් කුළිය

06-24 දින සිට ) ග වීමට කටයුතු කරනු ලැගේ.”

11

According to the document itself the ‘rent’ or its semantic variations had been

determined with the intervention of the Chief Valuer. This was also the position

maintained in “AP5”. In my opinion, these references reinforce the Petitioner’s

position that “R6” is not a tenancy agreement to pay a ‘rent’ but is in fact an

agreement to pay ‘compensation’. This is plainly understood by referring to the

statutory provisions relating to ‘compensation’ for property requisitioned under

the Co-Operative Societies (Special Provisions) Act No. 35 of 1970.

Determination of compensation.

Section 17.

(1) The Registrar shall refer to the Chief Valuer the determination of the

compensation payable in respect of any property, and such Valuer shall

submit his determination to the Registrar.

(2) The Chief Valuer shall, before making his determination of the

compensation payable in respect of any property, give the person from

whom that property was requisitioned for a principal society, as well as

the Registrar, an opportunity to adduce before such Valuer, by himself

or by a representative authorized by him in that behalf, evidence with

regard to the value of that property.

(3) The Registrar shall communicate in writing to the person from whom

any property was requisitioned for the principal society the

determination of the compensation payable in respect of that property

made by the Chief Valuer.

12

(4) The Registrar shall cause a notice to be published in the Gazette and in

at least one Sinhala, one Tamil and one English newspaper, specifying

the compensation that it proposes to pay in respect of any property, being

the compensation determined by the Chief Valuer, and inviting any

person who had any interest in that property, immediately before that

property was requisitioned for the principal society and who claims any

compensation in respect of that property, to communicate to such

Registrar his claim in writing, stating the nature and the basis thereof,

before such date as shall be specified in the notice.

According to these several provisions, where a property is requisitioned under the

Special Provisions Act, determining the compensation for such property falls

within the province of the Chief Valuer. Therefore, the reference to the chief valuer

in agreement marked “R6” could only be deemed a deliberate insertion to highlight

the statutory flavor of the agreement. Additionally, the words “මසකට රුපියල් 400

ක ප ත සඳ න් ගකාන්ගේසි මත පවරා ත් දින සිට (1974-06-24 දින සිට) ග වීමට

කටයුතු කරනු ලැගේ” is a cross reference to section 15 of the Act, which reads “The

compensation payable in respect of any property shall be considered as accruing

due from the date on which that property was requisitioned for the principal

society.” Apart from this, the Petitioner has presented two Gazette notifications

issued under the Co-operative Societies (special provisions) Act where the words

“මාසික කුළිය” and “වන්දි” had been used interchangeably to refer to compensation.

In light of these clear references, I am unable to agree with the contention that

“R6” is a stand-alone tenancy agreement.

More fundamentally, “R6” comes into existence as a direct result of the Requisition

Order issued by the Minister. This plainly rules out the possibility of construing

“R6” as a ‘contract’ or an ‘agreement’ to let the premises. The predecessor to the

property in question had no intention, at any point of time, of renting out his

13

building to the co-operative society. He, however had no choice but to comply

with the Requisition order under section 10 (1). This negates the fundamental

element of a contract—the element of voluntary meeting of minds. In terms of

section 29 (2) of the Rent Act No. 7 of 1972, a tenancy agreement could only arise

when the parties, in their private capacities, agree to let and occupy the premises

on mutually agreed terms.

“[…] it shall be lawful, with effect from the date of commencement of this Act, for

the landlord of any residential premises and the person seeking to be the tenant

thereof to enter into a written agreement whereby such premises are let to such

person for a period specified therein […]”

The statutory language bears no ambiguity that a situation of tenancy arises when

the landlord and the tenant agree to let the premises. This view is also shared by C.

J. Rustomjee in The Rent Act No. 7 of 1972 at page 7;

“A contract of tenancy is an agreement whereby one party agrees to give the use

of immovable property on a rent to another for successive period until it is

terminated by a notice given by either party”

The Law of Rent and Ejectment by Dr. Wijedasa Rajapakshe, PC [2005] J.B.J.L., Vol.

1, 219-223 further confirms that a tenancy agreement is firstly and primarily a

private agreement which arises outside the manacle of law. The intention of the

parties, the enforceability of the agreement, the identification of corpus and other

relevant terms are ascertained based on contractual principles.

The Rent Act only governs a tenancy agreement-it by no means creates one. Rather,

it presupposes that an agreement is already in place. Thus, the Respondents cannot

seek refuge in the Rent Act to colour themselves as tenants without firstly

14

establishing, based on contractual principles, that the predecessor in title to the

property intended to let the premises. The evidence before us speaks of, no such

agreement. In contrast, both parties agree that the 5th Respondent Cooperative

Society came into occupation pursuant to the aforementioned order by the

Minister.

The statutory nature of the payment is further amplified when one considers the

language of Section 13 of the Act which says: “In respect of any property

requisitioned for a principal society, such society shall pay compensation equal to

the amount which might reasonably expected to be payable for the temporary use

of such property”.

In these circumstances, I observe that the Court of Appeal erred in holding that

“R6” is a tenancy agreement that stands independent of the requisition order. “R6”

is not a tenancy agreement. It is an ancillary agreement made for the purpose of

paying and reimbursing the excess/shortfall of the compensation in respect of the

“Nathan Building.” As such, it cannot transform the 5th Respondent’s position to

that of a ‘tenant’.

Since there is no private agreement that ousts the writ jurisdiction, this Court will

proceed to consider the remaining legal issues in the chronological order. Firstly,

it is pertinent to examine whether the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that

there is a legal duty owed to her by the Respondents.

The 5th Respondent urged that it is only when there is a duty owed to the Petitioner

can a writ of mandamus be issued to compel the performance. Since in the present

application, the Petitioner has failed to assert any such legal right, they contend,

that a writ of mandamus should be refused. Citing Perera v National Housing

Development Authority 2001 3 SLR 50, they argue that “Mandamus is not

15

intended to create a right, but to restore a party who has been denied his right to

the enjoyment of said right”.

The requirement of a legal right becomes necessary in the writ jurisdiction for the

purpose of determining the locus standi of a Petitioner. While in the early days a

writ of mandamus was available only to those asserting a legal right, Courts in Sri

Lanka gradually moved away from taking this narrow approach. In Dilan Perera

v Rajitha Senarathna 2002 2 SLR 79 the court held that the “in mandamus the

petitioner must show that he is a person aggrieved of”. It has also been held,

although in a different context, that “on any view, the performance of that which

is an essential ancillary to the performance of one’s duty itself the performance of

one’s duty. To hold otherwise would be to give the word ‘duty’ an unduly restricted

meaning as to defeat rather than promote the general principles of the ordinance”

(Jayanetti v Mitrasena 71 NLR 385, 397) Furthermore, in Wickremaratne v

Jayaratne 2001 3 SLR 161 locus standi for the writ jurisdiction was expanded to

include legitimate expectations. U. De. Z. Gunawardena J. observed that “the

doctrine of inconsistency or of legitimate expectation prohibits decisions being

taken which confounds or disappoints an expectation which an official or other

authority or person has engendered in some individual except perhaps where some

countervailing facet of the public interest so requires-this being judged in the light

of harm being done to the applicant”.

In the present application, the Petitioner’s premises in suit was requisitioned by the

Minister in 1974 for ‘temporary use’. The petitioner was entitled to legitimately

expect that the property would be returned once the premises had been used for a

particular period. In particular, once the 5th Respondent Cooperative Society

moved to have a new building constructed, there was indeed no justification for

refusing to issue an order derequisitioning the Nathan Building. The sketch marked

“AP19” demonstrates that the 5th Respondent owns or occupies several other

16

buildings in Yatiyanthota Town which could be used for the purposes of the Co-

operative society. In these circumstances, the Petitioner and the Petitioner’s

predecessor in title are justified in expecting that the property will be returned to

them after a ‘temporary period’. To that extent there was a duty cast on the 1st

Respondent to order a derequisition of the property.

In any event, I am unable to see how the present application is different from the

authorities relied on by the Respondents. [Perera v National Housing Development

Authority 2001 3 SLR 50]. Undoubtedly, the Petitioner is the legal owner of the

property., which fact had been not contested by any of the Respondents. She is thus

fully entitled to all the benefits that accrue by virtue of her ownership.

Nevertheless, she has been continuously deprived of enjoying the benefits of her

ownership due to the excessively long period of possession by the 5th Respondent.

She only seeks that the property-which is rightfully hers- be returned to her

because the purpose for which it had requisitioned had been fulfilled. By the

Respondent’s own admission, this is a grievance captured by the writ jurisdiction

as a writ of mandamus could ‘restore a party who has been denied his right to the

enjoyment of the said right’. As such, I see no reason to reject the application on

the basis that the petitioner lacks the locus standi.

Having considered Petitioner’s locus standi, the Court must examine whether the

circumstances alleged by the Petitioner fall within the jurisdiction of a Writ of

Mandamus.

The Petitioner is pleading by a Writ of Mandamus for a ‘Derequisition order’

derequisitioning the property which was requisitioned under Section 10 (1) of the

Co-operative Societies (Special Provisions) Act No. 35 of 1970 published in

Government Gazette No. 108/9 of 26th April 1974 for the temporary use of the 5th

Respondent in 1974.

17

In an application for a writ of mandamus, the first matter to be settled is whether

or not the officer or authority in question has in law and in fact the power which

he or she refused to exercise. As a question of law, it is one of interpreting the

empowering statutory provisions. As a question of fact, it must be shown that the

factual situation envisaged by the empowering statute in reality exists.

Under section 10 (1) of the Co-Operative Societies (special provisions) Act No. 35

of 1970 the Minister has the power to requisition any immovable property by

publishing an order to that effect in the Gazette. The purpose of such requisition is

to allow the property to be ‘temporarily used by a principal society for the purposes

of any business of such society’ Furthermore, section 10 (4) of the same Act also

empowers the Minister to derequisition any such property by following the same

procedure. The section reads as; “Where any property is requisitioned by a

requisitioning order, the Minister may, by Order (hereinafter in this Act referred

to as derequisitioning order) published in the Gazette, derequisition such property

with effect from such date as shall be specified in the derequisitioning Order.”

Thus, there could be no question with regard to the Minister’s competence to issue

a derequisitioning order. What needs to be determined is whether the Minister’s

power is amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court. by Both sections 10 (1)

and section 10 (4) the Minister ‘may’ issue a requisitioning and derequisitioning

order. The text of the Act does not contain any express guidelines regulating the

exercise of the discretion. The issuance of the order therefore is a matter that has

been left to the discretion of the Minister.

Where power is conferred by law to exercise it in a given factual situation, it may

either be a duty or a privilege. Generally, it is only if there is a duty that the

repository can be compelled to act by a writ of mandamus. If there is only a

discretion (privilege) to act, the writ cannot compel the person to act. It was

18

pointed by the Counsel for the 1st to the 4th Respondent that “the word ‘may’

ordinarily connotes a situation where the exercise of a power is permissive or

discretionary as opposed to its exercise being obligatory or mandatory. Ordinarily

the word ‘may’ connotes a discretionary power and the word ‘shall’ connotes that

which is mandatory or in the nature of a duty the discharge of which is obligatory.

[…] And to use the words of Wade and Forsyth ‘mandamus has nothing to do with

the exercise of such discretionary power”.

However, it is a cardinal principle in Administrative law that no discretion is

unfettered and absolute in the public sphere. In fact, Wade himself confirms that;

“Statutory power conferred for public purposes is conferred as it were upon trust,

not absolutely - that is to say, it can validly be used only in the right and proper

way which Parliament when conferring it is presumed to have intended. Although

the Crown's lawyers have argued in numerous cases that unrestricted permissive

language confers unfettered discretion, the truth is that, in a system based on the

rule of law, unfettered governmental discretion is a contradiction in terms. The

real question is whether the discretion is wide or narrow, and where the legal line

is to be drawn. For this purpose, everything depends upon the true intent and

meaning of the empowering Act.” (5th Ed., page 353)

G.P.S de Silva CJ in his much-quoted dictum in Premachandra v Major Montegue

Jaywaickrema 1994 2 SLR 90, 105 held that “There are no absolute or unfettered

discretions in public law; discretions are conferred on public functionaries in trust

for the public, to be used for the public good, and the propriety of the exercise of

such discretions is to be judged by reference to the purposes for which they were

so entrusted.” This is also the position maintained by Dr. Cooray in Principles of

Administrative Law; “every discretion conferred by law is a public trust, to be

exercised for the purposes for which it has been conferred by statute, and the

proved factual situation in a given case may be such that, in keeping with the

19

purpose for which such discretion has been conferred by the statute, the law

discerns a duty to exercise that discretion in a particular manner and that duty will

be enforceable by mandamus.” (Volume II, 3rd edn, page 847).

Thus, even if the empowering statute does not expressly require any jurisdictional

fact to be present for exercise of power, it will be held invalid if the public authority

has acted in total disregard for the purpose for which such discretion/power was

vested in him.

The object and the purpose of the Co-operative Societies (Special Provisions) Act

No. 35 of 1970 as gleaned from its long title is;

“To make special provisions for the implementation of a scheme of reorganizing

the cooperative movement, in particular for the dissolution of societies and the

amalgamation of societies and for the matters connected therewith or incidental

thereto”

The Special Provisions Act was a legislative response to the economic policy that

was in place in the 1970s. This economic policy gave primacy to the co-operative

system and orders requisitioning private property were introduced solely to

“reorganize the co-operative movement” and for “the dissolution of societies and

the amalgamation of societies.” However, as the Act itself makes clear, the

requisitioning was to be made temporarily and catered to ‘the purposes of any

businesses of the principal society’. It was never meant to permanently dispossess

legal owners of their property. This is confirmed by subsection (7) which states

that a derequisitioning order has the effect of “reviving any lease subsisting on the

date on which the property was requisitioned.” Unless the requisitioning of

property was intended for a short period, section 10 (7) would have no meaning.

20

In the present case, the 5th Respondent Co-operative society has remained in

possession of the property for a period of 35 years. Furthermore, they have sublet

one floor of the Petitioner’s building to the National Apprentice and Industrial

Training Authority for computer training. It could not have been the intention of

the legislature to permit permanent use of requisitioned property. Neither can it

be said that this legislative enactment which gives primacy to ‘reorganize the co-

operative movement, in particular for the dissolution of societies and the

amalgamation of societies’ would allow using the requisitioned property for

financial ventures extraneous to the principal functions of the co-operative society.

Particularly in the present case, the sketch marked “AP19” amply demonstrates

that the 5th Respondent Cooperative Society owns or occupies several other

buildings in Yatiyanthota Town which could be made use both for the purposes of

the Co-operative society and for the aforementioned computer training facility.

Both the Petitioner and Petitioner’s predecessor in title repeatedly brought these

matters to the attention of the Respondents when they requested an order

derequisitioning the property [“AP 22-AP26 and “AP8” “AP9”]. The Petitioner’s

predecessor in title implored as far back in 1992 to have the property

derequisitioned as all his other property in the area was destroyed by the

communal riots. However, there was a persistent failure on the part of the

authorities to take cognizance of these grievances. When the petitioner again

moved for a derequisitioning order, the secretaries to the 4th and 5th Respondents

requested 2 weeks to respond but they never did so. To this day, there has been no

response from the authorities. The factual situation in the present case is such that,

in keeping with the purpose of the Act, an order derequisitioning the property

should have been made a long time ago. The discretion vested in the Minister in

this regard does not mean that he is empowered to withhold issuing the order as

he pleases. Where circumstances warrant, in particular where the premises have

been used for a period far exceeding the time frame contemplated in the

21

enactment , the law imposes a duty to exercise that discretion in a particular

manner- which in the present case is a derequisitioning order. Where there is a

failure in this regard, that duty would be made enforceable by a mandamus.

However, even if the circumstances qualify for the issuance of a writ of mandamus,

the Court could refuse to issue the same in the event the Petitioner is guilty of

laches.

The Court of Appeal in the judgment has held that “the petitioner’s premises were

requisitioned in 1974 and only after 34 years the petitioner moved to de-

requisition the premises. Even after the Court of Appeal judgment in the

acquisition case which was given in favour of the Petitioner she did not move to

get the premises derequisitioned. Only four years after the judgment the Petitioner

has filed the instant application. The petitioner has not given a proper acceptable

explanation for the very long delay. The only conclusion, this court can come to is

that there has been a contract of tenancy between the parties. A writ of mandamus

is a discretionary remedy which can be granted when there is no other remedy

available”

As rightly observed by the learned judge in the Court of Appeal, a writ of

mandamus is an equitable discretionary remedy which could be denied if the

Petitioner is guilty of inexplicable delays.

The traditional approach is that delay by itself is fatal to the application. However,

courts generally do not apply the principle of laches mechanically, but take in to

account the facts and the circumstances of the case. There is no criteria to

determine what constitutes delay. Whether there has been undue delay and

whether the explanation offered by the petitioner sufficiently excuses the delay is

to be decided by the Court.

22

Sharvananda J. as he then was, in Biso Menika v Cyril de Alwis [1982] 1 SLR 368,

380 observed as follows; “if the delay can be reasonably explained, the court will

not decline to interfere. The delay which a court can excuse is one which is caused

by the application pursuing a legal remedy and not a remedy which is extra -legal.

One satisfactory way to explain the delay is for the petitioner to show that he has

been seeking relief elsewhere in a manner provided by law” These words were

later cited with approval by Sripavan J. as he then was, in Samaraweera v Minister

of Public Administration [2000] 3 SLR 64, 66-67. His Lordship further observed

that “Further, the predisposition of parties to explore other lawful avenues which

hold out reasonable expectation of obtaining relief without incurring the expense

of coming into Court cannot be overlooked or censored and any delay caused

thereby cannot be characterized unjustifiable”

In Biso Menike v Cyril de Alwis, Sharvananda J. Held that the delay caused by the

Petitioner unsuccessfully making representation to a committee of inquiry

appointed by the Minister to look into injustices caused to the parties by the past

operation of the Ceiling Housing Property Law, No. 01 of 1973, under S. 17A (1)

under which Law the Commissioner of National Housing had the power, with the

approval of the Minister, to divest himself of the ownership of houses vested in him

under the law, was justified.

As correctly observed by the court of Appeal, the Petitioner in the present

application has invoked the writ jurisdiction of the Court to have the property

derequisitioned after 34 years from the date of requisition. However, attempts to

have the property derequisitioned commenced as far back as in 1992 by the

Petitioner’s predecessor in title making representation to the Respondents.

23

The initial attempt was made in 1992, wherein the petitioner’s predecessor in title

was promised that the request would be considered once the construction of a new

building was completed [“AP8”] In 2000 the Petitioner’s predecessor in title again

made representation to relevant authorities to derequisition property [“AP10”] On

the second occasion he drew attention to the completion of the new building and

claimed that there could be no further use for his property. In addition to these

representations, the Petitioner’s predecessor in title also took prompt action to

quash an order made by the Minister to acquire the building under the Land

Acquisition Act. [“AP13”] Once the title was vested in the Petitioner, she too made

representation to the Minister to issue an order of derequisition. Documents

marked “AP22” to “AP26” demonstrate these efforts. It was only after failing in all

these attempts that the Petitioner resorted legal action to have the property

derequisitioned. As such, it is clear that neither the Petitioner nor the Petitioner’s

predecessor in title has slept on their rights for 34 years. They had continued, albeit

unsuccessfully, to pursue their claims using other lawful avenues. In those

circumstances, the Petitioner cannot be held guilty of laches as she has provided a

justifiable explanation for delaying to invoke the writ jurisdiction.

The final question of law for determination is whether the single judge in the court

of appeal was bound by the decision given by the court of appeal sitting by a bench

of two judges.

The Petitioner has drawn our attention to a decision made by two judges of the

Court of Appeal in C.A. (PHC) 75/2008 Bandarawela Multi-Purpose Co-operative

Society v Periannen Nadaraja and Others (decided on 9th September 2010). The

Petitioners in the said application prayed for a writ of mandamus directing the

Minister to issue an order derequisitioning the property requisitioned under the

Co-operative Societies (Special Provisions) Act. The Court of Appeal in a

24

unanimous judgment which dealt with an identical situation and identical

statutory provisions held that:-

“Minister under section 10 of the Act No. 35 of 1970 can requisition a building

only for temporary use by a co-operative society. Such co-operative society cannot

use it permanently. The order of requisition was made in 1975 and the action in

the High Court was instituted in 2005. Then it is clear that the building has been

used for well over a period of 30 years. Thus, it is clear that the use of the building

by the co-operative society is not a temporary one. The co-operative society, the

Petitioner in this case, has used the building almost permanently. The co-operative

society has used the building beyond the purpose set out in the Act No. 35 of 1970.

I therefore hold that the learned High Court Judge was right when he issued a writ

of mandamus and certiorari prayed for by the Respondent”.

The present petitioner drew attention to this case when this application was first

instituted in the Court of Appeal. However, she claims that the Court of Appeal

failed to take cognizance of the judgment. A perusal of the Court of Appeal

judgment marked “L” confirms this assertion.

It is settled law in Sri Lanka that a bench numerically inferior regards itself bound

by a decision of a bench numerically superior. Basanayake CJ in Bandahamy v

Senanayake 62 NLR 313 elucidated;

“We have in this country over the years developed a cursus curia of our own which

may be summarised thus-

25

(a) One Judge sitting alone as a rule follows a decision of another sitting alone.

Where a Judge sitting alone finds himself unable to follow the decision of another

judge sitting alone the practice is to reserve the matter for the decision of more

than one Judge (88.38 & 48).

(b) A Judge sitting alone regards himself as bound by the decision of two or more

Judges.

(c) Two Judges sitting together also as a rule follow the decisions of two Judges.

Where two Judges sitting together find themselves unable to follow a decision of

two Judges, the practice in such cases is also to reserve the case for the decision of

a fuller bench, although the Courts Ordinance does not make express provision in

that behalf as in case of a single Judge.”

This was later followed by a bench of 5 judges in Walker Sons & Co. Ltd v

Gunatilaka & Others, 1978-79-80 1 SLR 231.

In those circumstances, Her Ladyship in the Court of Appeal erred when she failed

to give due regard to the unanimous judgement by a bench of two judges in C.A.

(PHC) 75/2008 Bandarawela Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society v Periannen

Nadaraja and Others (decided on 9th September 2010).

Having considered the questions of law referred to this Court and having answered

them in the affirmative, I hold that the Petitioner in the present application is

entitled to have her property derequisitioned under section 10 (4) of the Co-

operative Societies (Special Provisions) Act No. 35 of 1970.

Having considered the questions of law referred to this Court and having answered

them in the affirmative, I hold that the judgment of the Court of Appeal is

erroneous and set aside the same.

26

The court observes that the requisition had been made for “temporary use” of the

5th Respondent Cooperative Society and even after 43 years (1974 to 2017) the

building still remains as requisitioned property. In these circumstances, I issue a

writ of mandamus directing the 1 (e) Respondent forthwith to derequisition the

land together with the buildings thereon, requisitioned by order 101 published in

the gazette of the Republic of Sri Lanka dated 26th April 1974 bearing number

108/9 and the 5th Respondent to hand over vacant possession of the premises to

the Petitioner.
