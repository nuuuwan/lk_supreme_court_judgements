Argued on: 02.07.2018

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The Applicant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Applicant) who was employed

by the Respondent-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) in August

2006 as electricity supplier and a foreman, had worked under the Respondent until his services

were terminated by the Respondent on 1st March 2011.

3 As against the said decision of the Respondent to terminate his service, the Applicant had gone

before the Labour Tribunal of Chilaw and filed an application dated 1st June 2011.

At the conclusion of the Inquiry, by order dated 17th December 2014 the Labour Tribunal had

declared that the termination of the Applicant’s services is unlawful and a sum of Rupees 337,500/-

was ordered as compensation to be paid to the Applicant.

The said order of the Labour Tribunal was challenged by the Respondent before the Provincial High

Court holden in Chilaw and by order dated 25th May 2015, the High Court had allowed the said

appeal and set aside the order of the Labour Tribunal dated 17th December 2014.

Being dissatisfied with the above order, the Applicant had filed a special leave to appeal application

before the Supreme court, and the Supreme Court after considering the said application had

granted leave on the following question of Law,

“Did the High Court in the proper evaluation of the evidence err that the Applicant was not

an employee of the Respondent?”

As revealed before us, when the Applicant complained to the Labour Tribunal that the Respondent

unlawfully terminated his service, the Respondent responding to the said application had taken up

the position that the Applicant was not a ‘workman’ employed by him but was an ‘independent

contractor’ and that the Tribunal could not entertain the application.

In the said circumstances, the question that the Tribunal had to decide was whether the Applicant

was an employee of the Respondent or an independent contractor or in other words the

relationship between the Applicant and the Respondent was for a “contract of service” or “contract

for service”

4 Both, the Applicant and the Respondent have admitted that there was no written contract

between them and in the said circumstances, the Respondent took up the position that, the

Respondent worked as a contractor to the Ceylon Electricity Board, and after obtaining such

contracts, he sub-contracted the work to 3rd parties and shared the profit. In the said

circumstances he took up the position that the Applicant too was an independent contractor of the

Respondent who under took sub-contracts from the Respondent.

However, as against the said position taken up by the Respondent, the Applicant had taken up the

position before the Labour Tribunal, that the Applicant and the other workmen who worked for the

Respondent, had gathered at the house of the Respondent every morning to obtain instructions,

from him with regard to their daily work and similarly reported back to the Respondent around

5.30 p.m. During their work, either when they engaged in clearing the main lines or giving house

connections, they used the equipment provided by the Respondent. In the said circumstances the

case of the Applicant before the Labour Tribunal was that he was subject to the directions and

control of the Respondent during the period in question.

The Applicant in his evidence marked a document admitted to be in the hand writing of the

Respondent where at the top of the page Applicant’s name appears as “Sanjeewa”. The said

document refers to payments made to the Applicant for clearing electrical lines and supplying

Electricity for the period 2006-2007. In reference to A-1 the Respondent took up the position that

the said document has no connection to the Applicant but it refers to monies reserved for the

vehicles.

The learned President of the Labour Tribunal had considered the positions taken up by both parties

with regard to A-1 and rejected the position taken up by the Respondent. Whilst referring to the

evidence of the Respondent it was further observed by the President of the Labour Tribunal that,

5 the Respondent had not maintained a proper record of the payments made to his employees until

July 2011, a date subsequent to the termination of the Applicant.

As observed by this court, our courts have followed several tests to identify the relationship

between the two parties and control test is one such test accepted by our courts.

The said test was discussed by Sharvananda (J) (as he was then) in the case of M.D. Jamis

Appuhamy vs. T.P. Shanmugam, (1978) 80 NLR 298 at 299-300 as follows;

“The question of the applicant’s status, on the facts stated above, thus comes up for

decision. Was the applicant an employee under a contract of service or an independent

contractor on a contract for service? A contract of service is simply another name for a

contract of employment under which the parties are master and servant in the strict sense.

A contract for services, on the other hand, is a contract under which an independent

contractor agrees to render services to another in circumstances in which the relationship

of master and servant is not created. A servant is one who is bound to obey any lawful

orders given by the master as to the manner in which his work shall be done. The master

retains the power of controlling him in his work and may direct not only what he shall do

but how he shall do it. An independent contractor, as opposed to a servant, is one who

carries on an independent employment in the course of which he contracts to do certain

work. He may, by the terms of his contract, be subject to the directions of his employer.

But, apart from the contract, he is his own master as to the manner and time in which the

work shall be done.

6

In Collins vs. County Council, Hilbery, J. summarized the distinction in this way:-

“In one case the master can order or require what is to be done; while in the other

case he can, not only order or require what is to be done, but how it shall be done.”

In the case of The Times of Ceylon Ltd Vs. The Nidahas Karmika Saha Velanda Sevaka Vurthiya

Samithiya 63 New Law Reports 126 at 132, T.S.Fernando (J) had observed;

“Being in mind that ultimate test to be applied is whether the hirer had authority to control

the manner and execution of the act in question or, to put in the words to be found in the

judgment of the Supreme Court of India, whether there exists in the master a right to

supervise and control the work done by the servant not only in the matter of directing what

work the servant is to do but also the manner in which he shall do his work,….”

In the case of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd Vs. A.C.R. Wijesundera SC Appeal 99/2010 SC

minute dated 28.06.2017 Supreme Court observed that;

“Even though the Appellant submitted that there was no master- servant relationship

between the Applicant and the Appellant, I find that the Assessors had to sign daily when

they reported to work, had to provide reasons if they got late to work and the time of

arrival is later than 9.30 a.m. every day; they were not given assignments if they got late;

they had to report to the superior officer who gave the assignments every day before

9.30 a.m.; they were given equipment by the Appellant subsequent to them having used

their own equipment initially; they were paid travelling expenses and they were also paid

for the printed photographs taken by them of the damaged vehicles.”

“If any kind of work has to be performed independently, there cannot be any time

restrictions and there cannot be superior officers under whom the worker has to perform.

7

Any ‘contract for services’ has to be only for the work to be done by a person alone, using

his talent or capability as regards the particular kind of work, within his limits and within his

freedom. An independent professional performs his work with his expertise in the job and

the person who hires him on a ‘contract for services’ does not have any strings hung on

him. The services are appreciated and paid for, due to his capability to do the job which he

was hires to do. There cannot be any control whatsoever, if there is only a contract for

service. An independent contractor frequently carries on, an independent business whereas

under a contract of service, a man sells his labour and service to the enterprise of another.

In the case in hand, the Applicant sold his service and labour to the Appellant. The Appellant

in this case has had many controls over the Applicant and thus it points at the stance taken

up by the Applicant that the Appellant was his employer.”

As observed by me, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal was mindful of the said test when

concluding that there exists a master servant relationship between the Applicant and the

Respondent. (Pages 6-8 of the order)

The Appellate courts are reluctant to interfere with the findings of the Trial Courts including the

Labour Tribunal unless a serious miscarriage of justice has taken place when the Tribunal was

analyzing the evidence and the law relating to its findings.

In the case of Jayasuriya Vs. Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation 1995 2 Sri LR 379 at 391,

Amarasinghe J had observed the above as follows;

“The industrial Disputes Act No 43 of 1950 states in section 31 D that the order of a Labour

Tribunal shall and shall not be called in question any court except on a question of Law.

While Appellate Courts will not intervene with pure finding of fact, yet if it appears that,

8

The tribunal has made a finding wholly unsupported by the evidence or

Which is inconsistent with the evidence and contradictory of or

Where the tribunal has failed to consider material and relevant evidence or

Where it has failed to decide a material question or

Misconstrued the question and has directed its attention to the wrong matters or

Where there was an erroneous misconception amounting to a misdirection or

Where it failed to consider material documents or misconstrued them or

Where the tribunal has failed to consider the version of one party or his evidence or

erroneously supposed there was no evidence, the finding of the tribunal is subject to review

by the Court of Appeal.”

As observed above in this judgment, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal has correctly

analyzed the evidence placed before the Labour Tribunal and had applied the test relating to

identification of the relationship between the Applicant and the Respondent.

However when considering the judgment of the High Court of Provinces, I observe that the learned

High Court Judge had failed to appreciate the role of the High Court in an appeal process and has

merely given his interpretation to the evidence led before the trial court i.e. the Labour Tribunal

and interfered, with the finding on mere questions of fact.

The above position is in violation of section 31 D of the Industrial Disputes Act and contrary to the

decision in Jayasuriya V. Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation (supra) decided by the Supreme

Court.

9 In the case of Ceylon Cinema and Film Studio Employees Union V. Liberty Cinema Ltd [1994] 3 Sri

LR 121 the Court of Appeal too, had held that,

“The question of assessment of the evidence is within the province of the Labour Tribunal

and if there is evidence on record to support its findings the Appellate Court cannot review

those findings even though on its own perception to the evidence it may be inclined to

come to a different conclusion.”

For the reasons setout above I hold that the Learned High Court Judge has erred in law when he

interfered with the findings of the Labour Tribunal on a pure question of fact by giving his own

interpretation to the evidence and the documents led before the Labour Tribunal. I therefore

answer the question of law enumerated above by this court, in favour of the Applicant-

Respondent-Appellant and against the Respondent-Appellant-Respondent.

I further make order setting aside the judgment dated 27.05.2015 of the Provincial High Court

holden in Chilaw and affirm the order of the Labour Tribunal of Chilaw dated 17.12.2014.

Appeal allowed. However, I order no costs.
