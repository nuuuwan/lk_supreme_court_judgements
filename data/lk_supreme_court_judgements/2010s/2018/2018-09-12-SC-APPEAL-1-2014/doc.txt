ARGUED ON : 12.07.2018 WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS TENDERED ON : 18.03.2014 (By the Plaintiff-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant) DECIDED ON : 12.09.2018 Sisira J de Abrew J.

This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned Civil Appellate

High Court Judges wherein they have set aside the judgment of the learned District

Judge who held in favour of the plaintiff. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the

Civil Appellate High Court Judges the plaintiff-respondent-petitioner-appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff-appellant) has appealed to this Court.

This Court by its order dated 19.12.2013 granted leave to appeal on

questions of law stated in paragraphs 20 (i) and 20 (viii) of the petition of appeal

dated 20.01.2012 which are set out below.

i) Did the High Court err in law in its failure to apply properly the rule “balance

of probabilities” in the circumstances of this case whereas the learned District

Judge had come to a finding that the plaintiff proved his case on balance of

probabilities?

viii) Did the learned High Court Judges err by holding that the plaintiff has not

established the fact that the injuries caused to him were the result of the attack

4

carried out by the defendants while accepting the fact that there was a dispute

between two groups resulting in a fight and not relying upon the evidence of

Yasaratne Bandara, who in his evidence referred to the names of the

defendants by their fictitious names and the said item of evidence was not

impugned by the defence?

The plaintiff-appellant filed action against the 5 defendant-appellant-

respondents (hereinafter referred to as the defendant-respondents) for damages on the

basis that they have caused injuries to the plaintiff-appellant. Plaintiff-appellant

heavily relied on the evidence of Anuruddha Kumara who claims to be an eye

witness to the incident. Anuruddha Kumara in his evidence, has stated that the 1st

defendant assaulted the plaintiff Janaka Manjula with an iron rod. He also stated that

the 2nd respondent who was armed with a club was also present at the scene. He has

also stated in his evidence that the 3rd, 4th and the 5th defendant-respondents were also

present at the scene of offence. The most important question that must be decided in

this case is whether the evidence of said Anuruddha Kumara can be relied upon or

not. In short whether the said Anuruddha Kumara is a trustworthy witness or not.

Although he has stated in his evidence that the 1st defendant assaulted the injured

person (Janaka Manjula), in his statement made to the police he has not stated the fact

that the 1st defendant-respondent assaulted the said injured person Janaka Manjula.

In his statement made to the police he has stated that when he arrived at the scene of

offence the said Janaka Manjula had fallen on the ground with bleeding injuries and

5

the people who gathered at the scene were carrying the said injured person for the

purpose of taking him to the hospital. According to his police statement, it is only

after the said moment (the incident described above), the 1st defendant-respondent

arrived at the scene carrying an iron rod.

When the statement made to the police by Anuruddha Kumara is

examined it is very clear that he has not stated the fact that the 1st defendant assaulted

the injured person. Further, he has made the statement to the police only after 7

months of the incident (26.02.2016). According to this witness, the alleged incident

had taken place only on 21.07.2005. It is therefore seen that the statement made by

said Anuruddha Kumara is a belated statement. When I consider all the the above

matters, it is difficult to place reliance on the evidence of the said Anuruddha Kumara.

In my view his evidence cannot be believed on balance of probability.

Learned District Judge has concluded that the evidence of Anuruddha

Kumara has been corroborated by the evidence of Yasaratne Bandara who claims that

he was present at the scene of offence. But in his cross examination at page 84 he

(said Yasaratna Bandara) has admitted that he did not see the assault on Janaka

Manjula. Therefore, when the learned District Judge concluded that Yasaratne

Bandara had corroborated the evidence of Anuruddha Kumara it is, in my view, a

wrong conclusion. Learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court have observed

that the said conclusion reached by the learned District Judge was wrong. In my

view, the said observation made by the learned Judges of the Civil Appellant High

6

Court is correct. I have observed earlier that the evidence of Anuruddha Kumara

cannot be believed on balance of probability. Therefore, in my view the plaintiff-

appellant has failed to prove his case. The learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High

Court after considering the evidence have set aside the judgment of the learned

District Judge. After considering all the above material, I am of the opinion that the

conclusion reached by the Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court is correct.

Therefore, I do not intend to interfere with the said judgment. I affirm the judgment of

the Civil Appellate High Court dated 13.12.2011. Appeal of the plaintiff-appellant is

dismissed. Considering the facts of this case, I do not make an order for costs.

Appeal dismissed.
