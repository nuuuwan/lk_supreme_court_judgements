This is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated

18.3.2014 wherein the Court of Appeal refused an application to relist the appeal

filed by the Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the Defendant-Appellant). Facts of this may be briefly summarized

as follows:

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the Plaintiff-Respondent) filed action against the Defendant-

Appellant claiming damages for publishing a defamatory article on 5.12.1995 in

Sunday Leader News Paper which was owned by the Defendant-Appellant. The

case was decided ex-parte as the Defendant-Appellant was absent on the trial date.

Later an application to vacate the ex-parte judgment was dismissed by the learned

District Judge. Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned District Judge, the

Defendant-Appellant filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal. Having filed the

appeal in the Court of Appeal the Defendant-Appellant failed to make an

application to the Registrar of the Court of Appeal for issue of copies of the record

as set out in Rule No.4 of Supreme Court (Court of Appeal-Appellate Procedure-

Copies of Records) Rules 1978 which reads as follows.

“Within two weeks of the presentation of the Petition of Appeal the appellant shall

apply in writing to the Registrar of the Court of Appeal for the number of copies of

3

the record stating in such application whether the copies of the whole or portions

only, and if so of what portions of the record are necessary for the decision of the

appeal. Such application shall state the number of copies required by him. The

appellant shall within three days of his so filing his application serve a copy of the

same on the respondent who shall within seven days of receipt by him of the said

copy file in the said court a memorandum of any further portions of the record

which he considers necessary for the decision of the appeal and of such portion

which he considers unnecessary together within an application specifying the

number copies required by him.”

In the present case the Registrar of the Court of Appeal directed the parties to

appear in the Court of Appeal on 4.10.2011. On 4.10.20111 the Defendant-

Appellant was absent and unrepresented. The Court of Appeal on 4.10.2011

directed the Registrar of the Court of Appeal to notify the Defendant-Appellant to

pay brief fees on or before 31.12.2011 in terms of Rule 13(b) of the Supreme Court

(Court of Appeal-Appellate Procedure-Copies of Records) Rules 1978 and to be

present in court on 30.1.2012. The Court of Appeal also directed the Registrar of

the Court of Appeal to send a copy of the said notice to the Registered Attorney-at-

law of the Defendant-Appellant. The Registrar of the Court of Appeal complied

with the said direction of the Court of Appeal. But the Defendant-Appellant failed

to pay brief fees as directed by the Court of Appeal. On 30.1.2012 when the case

was called in open court, the Court of Appeal observed that the Defendant-

Appellant was absent and unrepresented and by judgment dated 30.1.2012

dismissed the appeal of the Defendant-Appellant in terms of Rule 13(b) of the

Supreme Court (Court of Appeal-Appellate Procedure-Copies of Records) Rules

1978. In February 2014 (the date is not mentioned in the petition) the Defendant-

Appellant filed an application in the Court of Appeal to relist his appeal which was

4

dismissed on 30.1.2012. It is noted here that this relisting application was filed two

years after the dismissal of the appeal. The Court of Appeal by its judgment dated

18.3.2014 refused the application to relist the appeal. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Defendant-Appellant has filed this appeal in

this court.

This court by its order dated 4.6.2014 granted leave to appeal on questions

of law stated in paragraphs 24(a) (b) and (c) of the Petition of Appeal dated

19.3.2014 which are set out below.

1. Did the Court of Appeal misdirect itself in failing to take into account that

there has been noncompliance with requirements of Rule 13(b) of the

Supreme Court (Court of Appeal-Appellate Procedure-Copies of Records)

Rules 1978?

2. Did the Court of Appeal fail to take into account that the order of the Court

of Appeal dated 30.1.2012, rejecting the appeal(C), had been based on the

presumption that the notice on the Registered Attorney-at-Law had been

served, whereas, such a presumption could not have been drawn in as much

as the said notice had not been dispatched to the proper address of the then

Registered Attorney-at-Law of the Petitioner Company?

3. Did the Court of Appeal fail to take into account that the notice dated

23.9.2011 requiring the attendance of the Petitioner in Court was flawed in

as much as it was not in breach of the requirement that the petitioner should

be noticed to deposit the brief fees?

This court also framed the following question of law.

5

Has the learned trial Judge indulged in a proper assessment of damages

having regard to the evidence placed before the Court?

If the answer to the aforementioned question is in the affirmative is the

amount of damages awarded excessive?

The Court of Appeal in its judgment dated 30.1.2012 observed the following

matters.

1. The notice sent to the Defendant-Appellant (dated 18.11.2011) had been

returned with an endorsement that the Defendant-Appellant was not at the

given address and that change of address (if any) had not been notified to the

Registry of the Court of Appeal by the Defendant-Appellant.

2. The notice sent to the Registered Attorney of the Defendant-Appellant is

presumed to have been served as the same had not been returned

undelivered.

The Court of Appeal rejected the appeal of the Defendant-Appellant for failure to

pay brief fees in terms of Rule 13 (b) of the Supreme Court (Court of Appeal-

Appellate Procedure-Copies of Records) Rules 1978. The fact that the notice dated

18.11.20111 sent to the Defendant-Appellant was returned undelivered with an

endorsement that the Defendant-Appellant was not at the given address is not

disputed by the parties in this case. The Defendant-Appellant in his petition of

appeal filed in this court takes up the position that after filing the appeal in the

Court of Appeal, his address was changed. Learned President‟s Counsel who

appeared for the Defendant-Appellant took up this position at the hearing before

us. But has the Defendant-Appellant notified the Registry of the Court of Appeal

about his change of address? This question is answered in the negative.

6

Learned President‟s Counsel who appeared for the Defendant-Appellant

relying on Section 27 of the Civil Procedure Code contended that court could not

send notice to the Defendant-Appellant when a proxy had been filed on his behalf

and that any notice should be sent to the Registered Attorney. I now advert to this

contention. Section 27 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows.

27. (1) The appointment of a registered attorney to make any appearance

or application, or do any act as aforesaid, shall be in writing signed by the

client, and shall be filed in court; and every such appointment shall

contain an address at which service of any process which under the

provisions of this Chapter may be served on a registered attorney, instead of

the party whom he represents, may be made.

(2) When so filed, it shall be in force until revoked with the leave of the

court and after notice to the registered attorney by a writing signed by

the client and filed in court, or until the client dies, or until the

registered attorney dies, is removed, or suspended, or otherwise

becomes incapable to act, or until all proceedings in the action are ended

and judgment satisfied so far as regards the client.

(3) No counsel shall be required to present any document empowering

him to act. The Attorney-General may appoint a registered attorney to

act specially in any particular case or to act generally on behalf of the

State.

Learned President‟s Counsel cited the judicial decision in the case of

Podisingho Vs Perera 75 NLR 333 to support his contention. In the said case His

Lordship Justice Wimalaratne (single Judge) observed the following facts.

7

“The defendant, tenant of the plaintiff, denied that he received a notice to

quit the premises let. In proof of the notice to quit, the plaintiff relied on the

copy of the notice and the registered postal article receipt. Although the

copy of the notice to quit contained the full address of the defendant, there

was no evidence that the same address was inserted on the envelope

enclosing the notice. In the postal article receipt neither the name of the

road nor the number of the premises was inserted.”

His Lordship held as follows.

“The evidence was not sufficient to prove that the notice to quit had been

properly addressed. The postal receipt was only proof of the posting of a

letter, but not proof of the posting of a letter properly addressed.”

In my view, the above judicial decision does not support the contention of

learned President‟s Counsel. Although learned President‟s Counsel advanced the

above contention, Section 27 of the Civil Procedure Code does not prohibit court

from sending notices to the parties.

Rule 13 (b) of Supreme Court (Court of Appeal-Appellate Procedure-

Copies of Records) Rules 1978 reads as follows.

“Where the appellant fails to pay the fees due under these rules, the Court of

Appeal may direct the appellant to comply with such directions as the court

may think fit to give, and may reject such appeal if the appellant fails to

comply with such directions.”

According to the above rule, the Court of Appeal has the power to send

notices to the appellant. Further the established practice of our judicial system is to

send notices to the parties although the proxies have been filed by their Registered

8

Attorneys. Considering all the aforementioned matters, I reject the above

contention advanced by Learned President‟s Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant.

If an appellant after filing an appeal changes his address given to court, it becomes

the duty of such appellant to inform the Registry of the Court of Appeal about his

new address. The Registry of the Court of Appeal cannot be blamed for his failure.

He has to suffer the consequence of his failure. The Defendant-Appellant did not

notify the Registry of the Court of Appeal about the change of his address. It is

therefore seen that failure to pay brief fees has occurred due to the negligence and

fault of the Defendant-Appellant. If the Court of Appeal cannot contact the

Defendant-Appellant due to the aforementioned failure and when the Court of

Appeal rejects his appeal, the Court of Appeal cannot be blamed. Once an appeal is

filed, it becomes the duty of the appellant and his Registered Attorney to make

inquiries of the appeal. After filing the appeal if the appellant fails to comply with

Rule 13 (b) of Supreme Court (Court of Appeal-Appellate Procedure-Copies of

Records) Rules 1978, the Court of Appeal has the power to reject his appeal and

also it becomes the duty of the Court of Appeal to reject such an appeal. If the

Court of Appeal does not perform this duty, the respondent would not be able to

implement the judgment of the court below. Such decisions of the Court of Appeal

would undoubtedly minimize the laws delay in this country. It has to be mentioned

here that the courts‟ appointments are definite and that it is the duty of the Judge to

conclude cases without any delay. This view is supported by the judgment of

Justice Amarasinge in the case of Jinadasa Vs Sam Silva [1994] 2SLR page 232

wherein His Lordship held thus:

“A judge must ensure a prompt disposition of cases, emphasizing that dates

given by the court, including dates set out in lists published by a court's

registry, for hearing or other purposes, must be regarded by the parties and

9

their counsel as definite court appointments. No postponements must be

granted, or absence excused, except upon emergencies occurring after the

fixing of the date, which could not have been anticipated or avoided with

reasonable diligence, and which cannot be otherwise provided for.”

It has to be noted here that the Defendant-Appellant filed the appeal in the Court of

Appeal against the judgment of the District Court in 1999 and the Court of Appeal

sent notices in 2011. When his appeal was dismissed on 30.1.2012, he filed a

relisting application only in February 2014. The above conduct of the Defendant-

Appellant shows the fact that he was not interested in his appeal.

Learned President‟s Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant next contended

that the decision of the Court of Appeal is wrong when it decided that notice issued

on Samararathne Associates (Registered Attorney) was presumed to have been

served as the same had not been returned. He contended that the correct address of

Samararatne Associates as borne out by notice dated 23.9.2011 is 810, “2nd Floor,

Maradana Road Colombo 10” but the address stated in the notice dated 18.11.2011

is “108, 2nd Floor, Maradana Road Colombo 10”. I now advert to this contention.

Although the number written in the notice dated 18.11.2011 is wrong, was the said

notice returned undelivered by the relevant post office? The answer is in the

negative. Although Mr.Samararathne in his affidavit dated 17.2.2014 stated that he

did not receive the notice dated 18.11.2011, it was not returned by the post office.

When I consider the above matters, I hold that the conclusion reached by the Court

of Appeal on 30.1.2012 that „the notice on Samararathne Associates (Registered

Attorney) is presumed to have been served as the same had not been returned

undelivered‟ is correct. For the above reasons, I reject the said contentions of

learned President‟s Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant. If the notice dated

10

18.11.2011 which is presumed to have been served on the Registered Attorney had

directed the Defendant-Appellant to pay brief fees and if the brief fees were not

paid by the Defendant-Appellant the Court of Appeal was correct when it rejected

the appeal. When the Registered Attorney received such a notice (directing the

Defendant-Appellant to pay brief fees) it becomes the duty of the Registered

Attorney to inform his client about the direction given by the Court of Appeal. I

have earlier held that the failure to pay brief fees had occurred due to the

negligence of the Defendant-Appellant. At this stage it is relevant to consider a

judicial decision in the case of Pakiyananthan Vs Singaraja [1991] 2SLR 205

wherin this court held as follows:

“Relief will not be granted for default in prosecuting an appeal where –

(a) the default has resulted from the negligence of the client or both the client

and his attorney-at-law,

(b) the default has resulted from the negligence of the attorney-at-law in which

event the principle is that the negligence of the attorney-at-law is the

negligence of the client and the client must suffer for it.

As the applicant's default appeared to be the result of his own negligence as well

as the negligence of his attorney-at-law the conduct of the appellant and his

attorney-at-law cannot be excused. The appellant had failed to adduce sufficient

cause for a re-hearing of the appeal.

It is necessary to make a distinction between mistake or inadvertence of an

attorney-at-law or party and negligence. A mere mistake can generally be

excused; but not negligence, especially continuing negligence. The decision will

depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. The Court will in granting

11

relief ensure that it's order will not condone or in any manner encourage the

neglect of professional duties expected of Attorney-at-Law.”

In my view when the appellant fails to pay brief fees as directed by court, the

Court of Appeal has the right to reject the appeal of the appellant in terms of Rule

13 (b) of Supreme Court (Court of Appeal-Appellate Procedure-Copies of

Records) Rules 1978.

For the above reasons, I hold that the Court of Appeal was correct when it

rejected the appeal of the Defendant-Appellant on 30.1.2012.

The Court of Appeal by its judgment dated 18.3.2014 rejected the application

of the Defendant-Appellant to relist his appeal. To succeed in a relisting

application, he must establish sufficient reasons for his failure to appear on the date

of argument. This view is supported by the judicial decision in Jinadasa Vs Sam

Silva (supra) wherein at page 234 His Lordship Justice Amarasinghe held as

follows.

“Where a party has established that he had acted bona fide and done his

best, but was prevented by some emergency, which could not have been

anticipated or avoided with reasonable diligence from being present at the

hearing, his absence may be excused and the matter restored. The Court

cannot prevent miscarriages of justice except within the framework of the

law: it cannot order the reinstatement of an application it had dismissed,

unless sufficient cause for absence is alleged and established. It cannot

order reinstatement on compassionate grounds. Inasmuch as it is a serious

thing to deny a party his right of hearing, a court may, in evaluating the

12

established facts, be more inclined to generosity rather than being severe,

rigorous and unsparing.”

In the present case, I have earlier held that the Court of Appeal was correct

when it rejected the appeal of the Defendant-Appellant on 30.1.2012. The

Defendant-Appellant has not established sufficient reasons for his failure to pay

brief fees and for his failure to appear on 30.1.2012. In view of the conclusion

reached above, I answer the 1st to 3rd questions of law in the negative. The other

two questions of law do not arise for consideration.

Considering all the aforementioned matters, I hold that the Court of Appeal

was correct when it rejected the application for relisting on 18.3.2014. For the

above reasons, I affirm the judgments of the Court of Appeal dated 18.3.2014 and

30.1.2012 and dismiss this appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
