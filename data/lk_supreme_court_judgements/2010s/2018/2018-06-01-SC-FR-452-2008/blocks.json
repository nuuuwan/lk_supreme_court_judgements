It is only thereafter that the 7th Respondent , Depanama Sugathabandu Thero had become the Viharadhipathi of the Sri Wijeyashramaya Temple. Since the said land was required by the UDA for a public purpose, it was agreed with the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation to transfer a portion of the land owned by the UDA (bounded by the Sri Jayawardenapura Mawatha, Rajagiriya which was adjoining another land of SLLRDC) to the SLLRDC in order to enable the SLLRDC to allocate a portion of land to the said temple, Sri Wijeyashramaya. Then the whole land within part of which the temple was situated including the blocks of land namely Lots 24, 25,22(part) and 23(part) in Preliminary Plan No. Co. 5534 made by the Surveyor General were amalgamated, re-surveyed and sub-divided by T.S.E. Wijesuriya Licensed Surveyor, on 16.07.1987 and Plan 1270 was prepared by him on 17.07.1987. The Surveyor had divided the land into three allotments, namely Lots 1,2 and 3.

The said Deed and the Board decision , the relevant memorandum and the cabinet sub committee minutes are also produced before this Court , marked as P3, P3A, P3B and P3C. Even though this Deed 18 is titled as a Deed of Declaration it is in fact \u201c a free grant to the temple.\u201d, in particular to the Viharadhipathi of the temple, his successors and the Shishyanu Shishya Paramparawa. The covenant number 6 of the said Deed 18 marked as P3 reads as follows: \u201c AND WHEREAS it has become expedient and necessary that there should be a declaration by the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation renouncing its right title and interest to the said Lot 1 in the Schedule No. 3 hereto fully described and that Rev. Depanama Sugathabandu, Viharadhipathi of the Sri Wijeyashramaya temple of Bandaranayakepura ( Kadurugastuduwa ), Rajagiriya his successors as Viharadhipathi of the said Sri Wijeyashramaya Temple in the Sishyanushishya Paramparawa , are entitled to the same.\u201d",

The land named as Lot 1 of Schedule No. 3 in the said Deed No. 18 is the subject matter contended in this Application , namely Lot 1 in Plan 1270 dated 17.07.1987 made by T.S.E.Wijesuriya Licensed Surveyor and Leveller of the land called Kadurugasduwa. I find that according to these two Deeds 314 and 18 , the land in question had become temple property which passes on according to the Shishyashishyanu Paramparawa , in terms of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance No. 19 of 1931 as amended. This temple, Sri Wijeyashramaya had been in existence from 1954. Documents P4 and P5 show quite well that the existing temple had a letter head with the name and address as it is and that there was a Dhamma School carried out by the said temple for the neighbouring children. After the demise of the then Viharadhipathi Nehinne Sadhdhasiri Thero in the year 1980, according to the Shishyashishyanu Paramparawa, his pupil, Depanama Sugathabandu Thero had succeeded to the post of Viharadhipathi. With the passage of time, the standard of the temple had come down and no development had taken place but the Buddhists who used to come had continued to come there and worship the Bodhi Tree, the Buddha statue and do their regular worshipping at the Viharaya. The 7th Respondent, Depanama Sugathabandu Thero seemed to have left the Sri Wijeyashramaya temple by the year 2004 and there had been no information at that time about his whereabouts. Yet, the Petitioners and the Buddhists in the area had continued to maintain the Viharaya by performing the religious activities at the Viharaya with the younger monks who were residing there at that time. On 03.06.2005, some unknown outsiders had reached the temple and had started to fence the property of the Sri Wijeyashramaya. It was prevented by the Petitioners and others in the area. At that time, the 1st Petitioner had held the office of \u2018controlling Viharadhipathi\u2019 of the temple at the request of the people who fostered the temple. On 25.07.2005 close upon 5 p.m. in the evening, the",

The members of the Dayaka Sabhawa of the temple and the people of the area had got together and had objected to such execution of writ. The report of the fiscal is marked with the Petition as P6. The same fiscal Piyarathna Muthukumarana had again gone there to execute the writ once again on 05.09.2005 and had failed to do so due to a massive crowd having objected to the same. I observe that the Buddhists in the area who had been the persons coming to the temple for worship are the people who had objected to the execution of writ at both times. The second fiscal report is marked as P6(A) and is before Court in which the fiscal explains how the people objected having gathered in crowds into the temple premises. The Petitioners had perused the case record in the case No. 20286/L and found out that the 8th Respondent, one Hewawasamge Padmalal Wijeratne had instituted the action seeking a declaration that he is the owner of the property in question, i.e. the land on which the Sri Wijeyashramaya was situated, on 22.04.2004. It is observed by me and should be noted that this person who had instituted action in D.C.Colombo Case No. 20286/L as Plaintiff, is not before this Court even though he is the 8th Respondent in this Fundamental Rights case and is not represented in this Court either. He has failed to get himself represented and/or to file objections to the Application of the Petitioners. The events which had taken place can be narrated thus: The property was declared as temple property by none other than the grantee, the SLLRDC by P3, Deed 18. The 7th Respondent who was the Viharadhipathi at that time had thereafter requested the 1st Respondent, the then Chairman of SLLRDC to transfer the said property to him , in his private capacity as a single private person. The 1st Respondent and the 3rd Respondent had acted in collusion with the 7th Respondent, Depanama Sugathabandu Thero and had transferred the said temple property in favour of the 7th Respondent by Deed No. 289 dated 11.03.2004 attested by A.C.S.N. Perera Notary Public. The Vendor was SLLRDC",

The very next day, i.e. on 12.03.2004, the 7th Respondent, Depanama Sugathabandu Thero had transferred the property in question, to the 8th Respondent, Hewawasamge Padmalal Wijeratne, the 8th Respondent, by Deed No. 368 dated 12.03.2004 attested by Rasika Subasinghe Notary Public, for a big sum of money as sale price, i.e. for a sum of Rs. 75 million. Then and there , by Deed 369 dated 12.03.2004 attested by the same Notary Public Rasika Subasinghe, the 8th Respondent, H.P.Wijeratne had mortgaged the said property to the 9th Respondent, Lanka Orix Leasing Company Ltd. and had obtained a loan of Rs. 75 million. Documents P7 is before Court. It is Deed 289 as aforementioned. P7A is the request made to the SLLRDC by the 7th Respondent, Depanama Sugathabandu Thero to transfer the property to his private name. P8 is Deed 368 and P9 is Deed 369. At this juncture I observe that as at present, according to the submissions made by counsel in this case , the fact that the said Depanama Sugathabandu Thero , the 7th Respondent , had passed away on 19.03.2012 is accepted by all parties before Court. The two persons who had signed on behalf of the SLLRDC as Vendors, namely Muthuvelu Manimuttu , the former Chairman of SLLRDC , the 1st Respondent and Valence Gunaratne, the then Acting General Manager of SLLRDC, the 3rd Respondent are not represented by any counsel before this Court. The person who bought the land and property from the 7th Respondent and who mortgaged the property to Lanka Orix Leasing Company Ltd. , namely Hewawasamge Padmalal Wijeratne , the 8th Respondent is also not present or represented before this Court. It is pleaded by the Petitioners that the transfer deed No. 289 had been executed after the dissolution of the Parliament in 2004 and all other allegedly wrong transactions had occurred before the General Election was held.

They had signed the deed on behalf of SLLRDC. The 9th Respondent, Lanka Orix Leasing Company Ltd. in its Statement of Objections has not pleaded that the SLLRDC had ever got the approval of the Board of Directors and Cabinet approval. Therefore it is a fact that the proper procedure had not been followed by the two authoritative persons before placing their signatures on Deed 289. There is no seal of the SLLRDC placed on that deed either. The said Deed 289 seems to be an invalid document. The 5th Respondent , the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs had sought the legal advice of the 11th Respondent, the Hon. Attorney General with regard to the property in question. This matter had been dealt with twice by the Attorney General. The inadequacy of documents brought to the notice of the Attorney General had resulted in an incorrect advice being given firstly and thereafter when all the documents were submitted to the Attorney General, a second advice had been given cancelling the former advice. This final advice is contained in the document 5R7 which was submitted to court with the statement of objections filed by the 5th Respondent. The advice contained in 5R7 is to the effect that Deed 289 is legally null and void and that by Deed 18, the property granted by the SLLRDC is \u2018temple property\u2019. Thereafter again, by a letter of advice dated 27.03.2008, marked as 5R8, the Hon. Attorney General had directed the 5th Respondent, the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs, to firstly get a Viharadhipathi appointed to the Wijeyashramaya temple, so that action can be taken under Sec. 28 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance. It is observed that the Viharadhipathi of Sri Wijeyashramaya , Depanama Sugathabandu Thero belonged to the Sri Lanka Ramanna Nikaya and sequent to the problems arisen by his actions in transferring the land to an outsider, the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs had written to the Chief Maha Nayaka Thero of Ramanna Nikaya , a letter dated 31.03.2008 requesting him to appoint a new Viharadhipathi to facilitate the process of taking legal action with regard to the problem, under Sec. 28 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance. In that regard, Depanama Sugathabandu Thero, the 7th Respondent had addressed a letter dated 24.01.2012 to the President of the Country, with a copy to the Chief Incumbent Maha Nayaka Thero of Sri Lanka Ramanna Nikaya, stating that he is",

    "text": "was meant to be always temple property to continue from one Viharadhipathi to the next Shishyanushishya Paramparawa in accordance with the provisions of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance. This letter IP3 is proof of the 7th Respondent having robbed the temple property from the Sri Wijeyashramaya. However he had not been able to get the SLLRDC Chairman and the Acting Managing Director to obtain the Board approval or the Cabinet approval for the said transaction. In this Application, the 9th and 10th Respondents challenge the validity of the Deed No. 18 which is a Deed of Declaration on the basis that the necessary rituals were not performed . Therefore, the said Respondents argue that the property remained with the 7th Respondent as property he received under the Deed No. 18. They argue that the second Deed by which the 7th Respondent received the property in question as a transfer from SLLRDC is Pudgalika property stands in his favour as a valid deed. The 9th Respondent argued that the said leading financial institution Lanka Orix Leasing Company Limited is a bona fide claimant to the land in question, in terms of the judgment entered into in the District Court of Colombo case No. 20286/L. It is also argued that the Petitioners are not legally entitled to seek relief to set aside the said judgment of the District Court without ever taking part in a judicial proceeding in the appropriate judicial forum meaning the District Court . The 9th Respondent challenges that the Petitioners are in effect challenging a judicial act and not an executive or an administrative action. The next argument is that the Petitioners are trying to vindicate a claim in respect of a land by way of a fundamental rights case and that it amounts to an abuse of judicial process. It is also submitted by the 9th Respondent that the Petitioners have no locus standi as they are not entitled in law to prefer any claim in respect of temple property. It is also alleged that the Petition is time barred and the 9th Respondent also complains that in this case leave to proceed was granted when the 9th Respondent was not represented in Court. I will address these arguments in the following paragraphs. The record of this case bears the date this application was supported in Court for leave to proceed. It was supported on the 29th October, 2008 before a bench comprising of the then Chief Justice S.N.Silva, Justice Sripavan and Justice",

It is the 7th Respondent, Sugathabandu Thero who had obtained the property in an unlawful manner and then had transferred the same to the 8th Respondent who mortgaged the same to the 9th Respondent. Therefore the predecessor in title whose title had descended to the 9th Respondent had been present in Court when leave to proceed was granted and after considering the submissions of the Petitioners and those Respondents who were represented only, leave to proceed under Article 12 and 14(1)e had been granted. The argument of the 9th Respondent that he was not represented and that the application is time barred cannot be gone into at this juncture and that is not an argument which could be considered at present. The 7th Respondent , his predecessor in title was represented in Court and it can be presumed that all the legal objections taken up by the 7th Respondent had been considered by Court prior to granting leave to proceed. The 9th Respondent being such a big legal person in the business world would have gone through the volume/folios in the land registry prior to granting such a big amount as Rs.75 million to the 8th Respondent and also would have gone through the deeds registered in the land registry, before the company decided to grant the mortgage of the land in question. The volume / folio where the land was registered when the same was granted by the SLLRDC to the Wijeyashramaya temple as temple land by P3 deed was also the same volume/folio where the 7th Respondent\u2019s deed P7 was registered. It is Volume/ Folio M 1482/250. The company definitely knew the fact that it was temple land which was improperly obtained as pudgalika property by the 7th Respondent which he passed on to the 8th Respondent from whom the 9th Respondent got the legal hold as mortgagee. The 9th Respondent cannot claim to be a bona fide claimant to the property in question. If at all, the company whose main office is situated in the adjacent land to the land in question would have happily taken a step to grant the money to the mortgagor, the 8th Respondent who had bought the property for Rs. 75 million by Deed 368 on 12.03.2004 and on the very same day mortgaged the same for Rs. 75 million by Deed 369. The 7th Respondent, Sugathabandu Thero got the property by Deed 289 on 11.03.2004 from the SLLRDC.

The 7th and 8th Respondent had collusively planned to get the property and transfer the same and thereafter mortgage the same within the shortest possible time period. The 9th Respondent had the knowledge of the improper actions of the 7th and the 8th Respondents and had agreed to grant the money. I find that the 9th Respondent is not a bona fide purchaser. The true value of 100 Perches of land by the side of the Jayawardenapura Mawatha, the main road in Rajagiriya would have been much more than Rs. 75 million at that time. The Petitioners in this Application are the persons who were the resident monk at the Sri Wijayashramaya temple and the president and the Secretary of the Dayaka Sabha of the temple. They are persons who are in charge of running the temple. The property of the temple has to be safeguarded by them for the Buddhists in the area to practice their religion which is a fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution. The Petitioners are not persons who are claiming the ownership of the land in question. They represent the Buddhists who are entitled in law to practice their religion including themselves, for whom the property on which the temple is situated is very important and worthy of preserving the same which was and had been continuously known and pronounced and held by the Viharadhipathi as \u201ctemple or sanghika property\u201d. The argument of the 9th Respondent that they have no locus standi to claim the property fails because they are before court alleging that their fundamental rights have been violated especially by the 4th Respondent, the SLLRDC, having acted in collusion with the 7th and 8th Respondents to wrongfully get paper title to the property as private property whereas the property was already declared as sanghika property. Furthermore, the 10th Respondent, the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs who has to secure temple and sanghika property according to Sec. 26 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance had been silent even after the complaints were made to him about the wrongful acts done by the 7th, 8th and 9th Respondents with regard to the property. His inaction has caused difficulties for the Buddhists in the area to practice their religion peacefully. The District Court case No. 20286/L was filed against the monk who was resident in the temple and the members of the dayaka sabha and even though it had been informed to the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs, he did not make any effort to intervene and do the needful to secure the sanghika property. At the end of the case writ of execution to get possession was",

The argument of the 9th Respondent that it is against a judicial act that the Petitioners are seeking relief from, fails.

The 4th Respondent SLLRDC, the 2nd Respondent who is the Chairman of the SLLRDC, the 5th Respondent who is the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs, the 6th Respondent who is the Minister of UDA, the 10th Respondent which is the Vidyaranya Winayakarma Sabhawa , the main temple the 7th Respondent Sugathabandu Thero was belonging to and the Honourable Attorney General have made submissions written and oral, to the effect that there is a violation of fundamental rights of the Petitioners enshrined in Article 12(1) and 14(1) e and that what is prayed for by the Petitioners in their Application to this Court should be granted. They admit the wrong doing of the corrupt officers of the SLLRDC by having granted a deed of transfer of the land in question as pudgalika property to the 7th Respondent. The particular land was already declared as temple property and granted to the Sri Wijayashramaya of Rajagiriya by the SLLRDC. Chief Justice Sharvananda in his book of Fundamental Rights in Sri Lanka , commenting on the application of Section 126 of the Constitution stated thus: \u201c This clause gives very wide discretion to the Court in the matter of the relief to be granted. Once it is established that a fundamental right had been infringed by an executive action, it is the duty of the Supreme Court to afford to appropriate relief. It is mandated to grant such relief as Just and Equitable in the circumstances. The relief must be according to law and principles of equity, justice and conscience.\u201d In the case of Omare Dhammapala Thero Vs Rajapakshage Peiris and Others 2004, 1 SLR 1, Dr. S.A.Bandaranayake J ( as then she was ) held that;",

    "text": "without a ceremony conducted according to Vinaya. Dr. Bandaranayake J ( as she then was ), in the same case had given her mind to the provisions of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance and stated that there is no reference to Sanghika property but Pudgalika property and temple property. She had gone through the previous case law and concluded that a temple could acquire property by civil modes of acquisition and that rituals are not required. As it is in the law of this country, the non performance of any ritual in any culture prevalent within the country cannot invalidate a transfer of immovable property done in accordance with the terms of the Notaries Ordinance. I hold that the Deed of Declaration No. 18 executed in favour of the Viharadhipathi of Sri Vijayashramaya temple remains valid at all times. The 9th Respondent\u2019s argument that the \u2018rituals like pouring water etc. were not done when the said Deed was executed and that makes it invalid\u2019 does not hold water. It is not a valid argument according to the law as prevalent at present with regard to temple property. Deed 18 was not a simple Deed of Declaration. It explained the background to such execution. The covenants contained therein are quite explanatory. The Sanghika Property was given by the Sri Vijayashramaya to the UDA for development purposes on the promise that another land will be given by the SLLRDC to the temple in exchange for the Sanghika Property given to the UDA by the temple. There is no way that the Sanghika property given can be exchanged for Pudgalika property. The Deed 289 granting the same property to the 7th Respondent is ab initio null and void. Such action admittedly is illegal , unlawful and invalid per se. All sales and mortgages are null and void. The 4th Respondent has acted in violation of the fundamental rights of the Petitioners when the 4th Respondent transferred the temple property without any ownership of the land in its hands to do so, after firstly, having granted the land to the Viharadhipathi of the Sri Wijayashramaya temple 17 years before such date of transfer. The said Deed 289 after all is not even a properly executed deed according to law.",
