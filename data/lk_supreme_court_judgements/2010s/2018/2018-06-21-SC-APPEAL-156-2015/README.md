The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred

to as the Plaintiff-Respondent) filed case No.5442/L in the District Court of

Kurunegala against the Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the Defendant-Appellant) asking for a declaration that he is the

lawful lessee of the lands described in the plaint and to eject the Defendant-

Appellant. The learned District Judge by his judgment dated 1.9.2005 granted

relief sought by the Plaintiff-Respondent. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment of the learned District Judge, the Defendant-Appellant appealed to

the Civil Appellate High Court. The Civil Appellate High Court by its

judgment dated 8.11.2012 dismissed the appeal. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court, the Defendant-Appellant has

appealed to this court. This court by its order dated 22.9.2015, granted leave

to appeal on questions of law set out in paragraphs 17(a),(b) and (c) of the

petition of appeal dated 20.12.2012 which are set out below.

1. In the circumstances of the case, has the plaintiff established before

court the ownership of the two lands in dispute vested with Maha

Vishnu Dewalaya of Kandy and the plaintiff is the lawful tenant/lessee

of the lands in dispute?

2. Has the plaintiff identified the land in dispute to obtain a declaration

that he is the tenant of the lands?

3. In the circumstances pleaded, are the judgments of the learned District

Judge as well as the Civil Appellate High Court according to law and

according to the evidence adduced in the case?

The Plaintiff-Respondent in his plaint and evidence claims that he, on a

permit issued by Vishnu Dewalaya Kandy marked P4, was in possession of

the lands described in the plaint; that he is the lawful lessee of the said

property; that in October 1997 the Defendant-Appellant forcibly entered the

said property; that on 13.10.1997 he made a complaint to Gokarella Police

Station complaining of the said unlawful acts of the Defendant-Appellant; and

that he is the lawful lessee of the said property.

The Defendant-Appellant in his answer and the evidence takes up the

position that he is the owner of the property described in the plaint. He relies

on Deed No. 16016 dated 20.11.1997 (V1) attested by Padma Kumari

Wanigasuriya, Notary Public.

On an application made by the Plaintiff-Respondent, District Court

issued a commission on H.M. Karunaratne Licensed Surveyor who prepared

Plan No.24899. The said plan was produced at the trial marked as P1. H.M.

5

Karunaratne Licensed Surveyor in his evidence states that he surveyed the

lands described in the plaint and that the lands described in the plaint are

depicted in his Plan No. 24899. The Defendant-Appellant too made an

application for a commission and the District Court issued a commission on

H.B.Abeyratne Licensed Surveyor who prepared Plan No.2885. The lands

described in the plaint according to the evidence of the Plaintiff-Respondent

and H.M. Karunaratne Licensed Surveyor are situated in a village called

Kumbukgate and the names of the lands are Dalupothyaya and Paluwatta. Are

these the same lands claimed by the Defendant-Appellant? When

H.B.Abeyratne Licensed Surveyor surveyed the land, the Defendant-

Appellant has shown the land. But the land shown by the Defendant-

Appellant is not situated in a village called Kumbukgate. It is situated in a

village called Waliharagedera. The distance between Kumbukgate and

Waliharagedera is about one kilometer. Further the name of the land shown

by the Defendant-Appellant is Galkamathagawa Godapillaawa

Dambagahamulahena. It has to be noted here that the land described in the

plaint is situated in Kumbukgate. Further the Plaintiff-Respondent too had

been present when the when H.B.Abeyratne Licensed Surveyor surveyed the

land. The Plaintiff-Respondent had told H.B.Abeyratne Licensed Surveyor

that this was not the land in dispute. The above evidence has been given by

H.B.Abeyratne Licensed Surveyor. When the above evidence is considered, it

is clear that the land described by the Defendant-Appellant is not the land

described in the plaint. The Defendant-Appellant relies on Deed No.16016

dated 20.11.1997 marked (V1). The said deed too described the land situated

in a village called Waliharagedera and the name of the land is

6

Galkamathagawa Pillaawa Dambagahamulahena. When I consider all the

above matters, I am of the opinion that the Defendant-Appellants claim that

he is the owner of the lands described in the plaint cannot be accepted and

should be rejected. When I consider all the above matters, the contention of

learned counsel for the Defendant-Appellant that the corpus had not been

identified has to be rejected and is hereby rejected.

The Land Officer of the Vishnu Dewalaya Kandy K.B.Piyasiri states

in his evidence that the land described in the permit marked P4 was leased to

the Plaintiff-Respondent; that the Plaintiff-Respondent has been paying yearly

rent to the Vishnu Dewalaya Kandy; and that permit marked P4 was issued by

Basnayake Nilame of the Vishnu Dewalaya Kandy. When I consider all the

above matters, I hold that the judgment of the learned District Judge giving

relief to the Plaintiff-Respondent is correct and the judgment of the Civil

Appellate High Court dismissing the appeal of the Defendant-Appellant too is

correct. In view of the conclusion reached above, I answer the 1st question of

law as follows.

The Plaintiff-Respondent has established that he is the lawful lessee of

the lands in dispute.

The 2nd question of law is answered as follows.

The Plaintiff-Respondent has identified the lands in dispute to obtain a

declaration that he is the lessee of the lands described in the plaint.

The 3rd question of law is answered as follows.

7

Both judgments of the District Court and the Civil Appellate High Court are

correct.

For the above reasons, I affirm the judgments of the District Court and

the Civil Appellate High Court and dismiss this appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed.

Judge of the Supreme Court.

Prasanna Jayawardena PC J

I agree.

Judge of the Supreme Court.

L.T.B.Dehideniya J

I agree.

Judge of the Supreme Court.
