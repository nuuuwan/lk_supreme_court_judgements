He imports used cars from Japan and sells them in Sri Lanka. The 2nd to 6th petitioners are persons who are said to have imported used Nissan \u201cLeaf\u201d electric cars through the 1st petitioner\u2019s business, in the year 2015. The petitioners\u2019 case is that, in terms of the Orders made by the Minister of Finance under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act No. 13 of 1989, as amended, and related directives issued by the Ministry of Finance, the petitioners are liable to pay Excise Duty at a rate of only 5% of the value of these cars prior to clearing these cars through customs and having them released from the port in Hambantota. The petitioners complain that the respondents have arbitrarily and unlawfully required the petitioners to pay Excise Duty at the rate of 50% of the value of the cars. The petitioners state they have not paid Excise Duty at the rate of 50% because they are not liable to do so and that, as result of this stalemate, the cars are still at the port. The petitioners annexed the documents marked \u201cP1\u201d to \u201cP10\u201d with their petition. This Court granted the petitioners leave to proceed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. The 5th respondent - who is the Director General of the Department of Fiscal Policy - filed his affidavit along with the documents marked \u201cR1\u201d to \u201cR8\u201d. The 7th petitioner filed a counter affidavit with the documents marked \u201cP11\u201d to \u201cP13\u201d. It is common ground that, from 27th February 2015 onwards, used Nissan \u201cLeaf\u201d electric cars imported into Sri Lanka were regarded as motor vehicles falling with the description \u201cOther electric, not more than three years old\u201d bearing the classification H.S. Code 8703.90.30 [the Harmonized Commodity Description and Codification System which is internationally used for purposes of tariff nomenclature]. This and other classifications in the H.S. Code are used, inter alia, for the purposes of fixing the Excise Duty payable at the time articles are imported into Sri Lanka. It is also common ground that the Order dated 26th February 2015 marked \u201cP1\u201d made by the 2nd respondent [Minister of Finance] under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, fixed at 5% the Excise Duty payable on cars falling within the classification bearing H.S.

They say that, therefore, the 1st to 6th petitioners decided to import Nissan \u201cLeaf\u201d electric cars for their personal use. The petitioners go on to aver that the 1st to 6th petitioners obtained the services of the 7th petitioner and placed orders with him to import Nissan \u201cLeaf\u201d electric cars falling within the classification of H.S. Code 8703.90.30. The 1st to 6th petitioners say they made advance payments to the 7th petitioner for that purpose and authorized him to import these cars for and on their behalf. They say the 7th petitioner established letters of credit to import these cars for their personal use. These letters of credit were marked \u201cP2A\u201d to \u201cP2F\u201d. They have been established on 29th October 2015 or on 30th October 2015. A perusal of these documents show that the letter of credit marked \u201cP2A\u201d is for the import of one car. The letter of credit marked \u201cP2B\u201d is for the import of three cars and both \u201cP2C\u201d and \u201cP2E\u201d are copies of \u201cP2B\u201d. The letter of credit marked \u201cP2D\u201d is for the import of two cars and \u201cP2F\u201d is a copy of \u201cP2D\u201d. Thus, the documents marked \u201cP2A to \u201cP2F\u201d show that the 7th petitioner established three letters of credit to import a total number of six cars. The petitioners say these six cars were imported for the personal use of the 1st to 6th petitioners. The 2016 Budget of the Government presented by the 2nd respondent [Minister of Finance] proposed to increase the Excise Duty payable on Nissan \u201cLeaf\u201d electric cars imported into Sri Lanka to 50% of the value of the car. In terms of that proposal, the 2nd respondent made the Order dated 20th November 2015 marked \u201cP3\u201d under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act fixing such Excise Duty at 50% with effect from 21st November 2015. The 2016 Budget was passed by Parliament on 19th December 2015. The petitioners say that they believed that the increased Excise Duty of 50% which came into effect from 21st November 2015 onwards would be not be applied to the electric cars imported for them since the aforesaid letters of credit had been established long prior to that date - ie: that they were liable to only pay Excise Duty at the earlier rate of 5% which prevailed prior to 20th November 2015. The ship carrying these six cars reached the port at Hambantota on or about 02nd December 2015 and the vehicles were unloaded. When the petitioners tried to clear the six cars on payment of 5% Excise Duty, they were not allowed to do so. Thereafter, the 2nd respondent made the Order dated 11th January 2016 marked \u201cP4\u201d under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act amending the earlier Order marked \u201cP3\u201d and stating, inter alia, that Excise Duty will apply at the rate of 5% specified in \u201cP1\u201d in respect of \u201cA motor vehicle imported solely for private use in respect of which the Letter of Credit (LC) was opened on or before 20.11.2015 and registered the vehicle on or before 31.03.2016 in the name of the person who uses it for his/her private purposes and shall not be transferred for a period of five (05) years from the date of registration without prior approval from the General Treasury.\u201d.

    "text": "notwithstanding the increased rate of Excise Duty of 50% specified in \u201cP3\u201d, \u201cP4\u201d stated that Excise Duty was to be applied at the earlier rate of 5% for cars imported under letters of credit established prior to 20th November 2015 provided the car had been imported \u201csolely for private use\u201d and the car was registered \u201cin the name of person who uses it for his/her private purposes\u201d on or before 31st March 2016. However, the respondents later realized that there was a business practice in the motor vehicle import trade, for vehicle importers to sometimes establish letters of credit in their own names when they were executing orders placed by customers to import vehicles for the customer\u2019s personal use. To meet this type of situation the Ministry of Finance issued a notification dated 13th January 2016 marked \u201cP5\u201d stating \u201cFurther, vehicle importers who have imported motor vehicles for personal use on LCs opened before Budget 2016 are permitted to be cleared from the Customs by paying the Duties under the rate prevailed at 20.11.2015, without paying any demurrages.\u201d. Thus, \u201cP5\u201d clarified that the scope of the Order marked \u201cP4\u201d extended to instances where a car had been imported for the \u201cpersonal use\u201d of a person under a letter of credit that had been established prior to 20th November 2015 in the name of a vehicle importer. Thereafter, the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury wrote the letter dated 21st January 2016 marked \u201cP6\u201d to the 3rd respondent [Director General of Customs]. This letter sets out how a person who is claiming that he is liable to pay Excise Duty at the earlier rate of 5% should demonstrate that the car has, in fact, been imported for his \u201cpersonal use\u201d even though the letter of credit is established in the name of a vehicle importer. In this regard, \u201cP6\u201d explains that such a person will be entitled pay Excise Duty at only 5% \u201c\u2026.. if sufficient proof is furnished to the satisfaction of the Director General of Department of Fiscal Policy that the vehicle is imported for such individuals\u2019 personal use. For this purpose, documentary evidence obtained from a bank that he/she has paid full or partial payment to the importer should be submitted along with the other documents.\u201d. In March 2016, the 1st to 6th petitioners submitted applications to the 5th respondent [Director General of the Department of Fiscal Policy] in terms of \u201cP6\u201d seeking approval to pay Excise Duty at the earlier rate of 5%. The petitioners submitted the documents marked \u201cP7(a)\u201d to \u201cP7(f)\u201d seeking to establish that the cars had been imported for the \u201cpersonal use\u201d of the 1st to 6th petitioners and that the 1st to 6th petitioners had \u201cpaid full or partial payment\u201d to the 7th petitioner [ie: to the vehicle importer]. However, by his letters dated 28th March 2016 marked \u201cP9A\u201d to \u201cP9F\u201d, the 5th respondent advised the 1st to 6th petitioners that their applications had been refused since the evidence submitted did not substantiate the requirements of \u201cP4\u201d.",

This burden was particularly difficult in the case of individuals who had imported electric cars for their personal use. In this background, the Cabinet of Ministers has taken the Cabinet Decision dated 06th January 2016 marked \u201cR2\u201d that taxes and levies on cars imported under letters of credit established prior to 20th November 2015 should be charged at the rates which prevailed prior to 20th November 2015, provided the car was imported for the official or personal use of the person for whom the car was imported and not for any commercial purpose. It is also evident that the Order dated 11th January 2016 marked \u201cP4\u201d was issued a few days later in pursuance of that decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers. Thus, the Order marked \u201cP4\u201d stipulated, inter alia, that Excise Duty was to be applied at the earlier rates specified in \u201cP1\u201d if the car was \u201cimported solely for private use\u201d.",

While large scale vehicle importers may have a practice of receiving written orders and entering into written contracts prior to executing orders to import vehicles for the personal use of their customers, small scale vehicle importers who operate more informally may not necessarily obtain such formal documentation. In these circumstances, insisting on the 1st to 6th petitioners submitting written orders and written contracts to pass the hurdle of proving that the cars were imported for their personal use, would amount to imposing an unrealistic and unfair standard of proof upon them. In my view, it is necessary to keep in mind the purpose for which \u201cP4\u201d, \u201cP5\u201d and \u201cP6\u201d were issued and the fact that the petitioners were placed in the unexpected situation of being called upon to now produce documentation which they may not have seen any reason to insist on at the time the orders and advance payments were made.

In fact, it appears that, unlike in the case of the 1st to 6th petitioners, Ms. Rathnayaka had not even furnished a signed declaration that the car was imported for her personal use. However, the 5th respondent has taken the view that the documents marked \u201cR4\u201d and \u201cR5\u201d which only proved that Ms. Rathnayaka\u2019s husband had paid Rs. 2,953,500/- to the vehicle importer\u2019s bank account, were sufficient to establish that the car had been imported for her personal use. This is seen from the letter marked \u201cP10\u201d written by the 5th respondent to the 3rd respondent which states \u201cMrs. Rathnayaka has submitted documentary evidence that an advance payment for importing of this vehicle is paid by his personal bank account to the importer (Copies of those letters of evidence are herewith attached). As such, it fulfills the requirement that the vehicle is imported for the individual\u2019s personal use and satisfies that the vehicle is imported solely for the private use \u2026..\u201d. It should be mentioned here that the letter of credit and commercial invoice marked \u201cR6\u201d and \u201cR7\u201d do not given any indication that the car mentioned in those documents was imported for or on behalf of Ms. Rathnayaka or that she had made full or partial payment to the vehicle importer. The document marked \u201cR8\u201d is another copy of the letter marked \u201cP10\u201d.",

A further restriction is placed by prohibiting that person from transferring the car to someone else for a period of five years without prior approval from the General Treasury. This makes it more likely that a person who submits to these restrictions does, in fact, intend to use the car for his or her personal use. Taking into account the factors set out above and the observations made earlier with regard to the appropriate standard of proof which the 5th respondent should use in this type of application made to him, I am of the view that, in the circumstances of this particular case, the 5th respondent should have regarded the signed declarations by the 1st to 6th petitioners as sufficient to meet the first requirement specified in \u201cP6\u201d - ie: that the cars were imported for the personal use of the 1st to 6th petitioners.

It should be mentioned here that one letter issued by the bank confirming the deposit of Rs. 2,200,000/- to the 7th petitioner\u2019s bank account on 26th October 2015 and one deposit voucher recording a deposit of Rs.2,200,000/- on 26th October 2015 have been produced in respect of both the 5th and 6th petitioners.

The documents which indicate that these sums of money were then paid by the 1st to 6th petitioners to the 7th petitioner are the receipts described in (iii) above.

These amounts range from Rs. 500,000/- to Rs.1,600,000/-. The 1st to 6th petitioners are unlikely to have withdrawn such large sums of money from their bank accounts unless the withdrawal was for the specific purpose of making a significant purchase or meeting a financial commitment. These are certainly not amounts which would have been withdrawn for ordinary day-to-day expenses. It has to be also kept in mind that the sums were withdrawn from their bank accounts long prior to any hint of the increase in Excise Duty on 20th November 2015. This lends credence to the 1st to 6th petitioners\u2019 statements that they withdrew these large sums for the specific purpose of making advance payments to the 7th petitioner.",

With regard to the respondents\u2019 submission that the receipts should be rejected because they do not bear a printed serial number, I do not think that the absence of a serial number necessarily negates the authenticity of the receipts. It could well be that the 7th petitioner saw no need to print serial numbers on receipts he used.

    "text": "deposited by the 7th petitioner to his bank account. Thus, it appears that the 5th respondent has failed to carefully examine these documents and understand what they established. It seems he has acted mechanically and rejected the petitioners\u2019 applications simply because there was no document issued by a bank stating that the 1st to 6th petitioners had each directly paid monies into the 7th petitioner\u2019s bank account. He has failed to see what was plainly before him - ie: that when \u201cP12(a)\u201d to \u201cP12(f)\u201d are viewed together with \u201cP7(a)\u201d to \u201cP7(f)\u201d, they show that the advance payments made by the 1st to 6th petitioners to the 7th petitioner were later deposited by him to his bank account and, therefore, the petitioners had satisfied the requirements set out in \u201cP6\u201d. Thereby, the 5th respondent has failed to properly apply \u201cP4\u201d, \u201cP5\u201d and \u201cP6\u201d and he has failed to ensure the purpose for which these Orders and directions were made and issued. In these circumstances, the 5th respondent\u2019s refusal of the petitioner\u2019s application made under \u201cP4\u201d, \u201cP5\u201d and \u201cP6\u201d is irrational, unreasonable, arbitrary and improper.",
