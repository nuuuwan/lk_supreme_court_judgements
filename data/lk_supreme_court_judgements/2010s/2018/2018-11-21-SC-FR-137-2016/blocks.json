He imports used cars from Japan and sells them in Sri Lanka. The 2nd to 6th petitioners are persons who are said to have imported used Nissan Leaf electric cars through the 1st petitioners business, in the year 2015. The petitioners case is that, in terms of the Orders made by the Minister of Finance under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act No. 13 of 1989, as amended, and related directives issued by the Ministry of Finance, the petitioners are liable to pay Excise Duty at a rate of only 5% of the value of these cars prior to clearing these cars through customs and having them released from the port in Hambantota. The petitioners complain that the respondents have arbitrarily and unlawfully required the petitioners to pay Excise Duty at the rate of 50% of the value of the cars. The petitioners state they have not paid Excise Duty at the rate of 50% because they are not liable to do so and that, as result of this stalemate, the cars are still at the port. The petitioners annexed the documents marked P1 to P10 with their petition. This Court granted the petitioners leave to proceed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. The 5th respondent - who is the Director General of the Department of Fiscal Policy - filed his affidavit along with the documents marked R1 to R8. The 7th petitioner filed a counter affidavit with the documents marked P11 to P13. It is common ground that, from 27th February 2015 onwards, used Nissan Leaf electric cars imported into Sri Lanka were regarded as motor vehicles falling with the description Other electric, not more than three years old bearing the classification H.S. Code 8703.90.30 [the Harmonized Commodity Description and Codification System which is internationally used for purposes of tariff nomenclature]. This and other classifications in the H.S. Code are used, inter alia, for the purposes of fixing the Excise Duty payable at the time articles are imported into Sri Lanka. It is also common ground that the Order dated 26th February 2015 marked P1 made by the 2nd respondent [Minister of Finance] under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, fixed at 5% the Excise Duty payable on cars falling within the classification bearing H.S. Code 8703.90.30. The petitioners state that this Excise Duty of only 5% was fixed to",

They say that, therefore, the 1st to 6th petitioners decided to import Nissan Leaf electric cars for their personal use. The petitioners go on to aver that the 1st to 6th petitioners obtained the services of the 7th petitioner and placed orders with him to import Nissan Leaf electric cars falling within the classification of H.S. Code 8703.90.30. The 1st to 6th petitioners say they made advance payments to the 7th petitioner for that purpose and authorized him to import these cars for and on their behalf. They say the 7th petitioner established letters of credit to import these cars for their personal use. These letters of credit were marked P2A to P2F. They have been established on 29th October 2015 or on 30th October 2015. A perusal of these documents show that the letter of credit marked P2A is for the import of one car. The letter of credit marked P2B is for the import of three cars and both P2C and P2E are copies of P2B. The letter of credit marked P2D is for the import of two cars and P2F is a copy of P2D. Thus, the documents marked P2A to P2F show that the 7th petitioner established three letters of credit to import a total number of six cars. The petitioners say these six cars were imported for the personal use of the 1st to 6th petitioners. The 2016 Budget of the Government presented by the 2nd respondent [Minister of Finance] proposed to increase the Excise Duty payable on Nissan Leaf electric cars imported into Sri Lanka to 50% of the value of the car. In terms of that proposal, the 2nd respondent made the Order dated 20th November 2015 marked P3 under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act fixing such Excise Duty at 50% with effect from 21st November 2015. The 2016 Budget was passed by Parliament on 19th December 2015. The petitioners say that they believed that the increased Excise Duty of 50% which came into effect from 21st November 2015 onwards would be not be applied to the electric cars imported for them since the aforesaid letters of credit had been established long prior to that date - ie: that they were liable to only pay Excise Duty at the earlier rate of 5% which prevailed prior to 20th November 2015. The ship carrying these six cars reached the port at Hambantota on or about 02nd December 2015 and the vehicles were unloaded. When the petitioners tried to clear the six cars on payment of 5% Excise Duty, they were not allowed to do so. Thereafter, the 2nd respondent made the Order dated 11th January 2016 marked P4 under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act amending the earlier Order marked P3 and stating, inter alia, that Excise Duty will apply at the rate of 5% specified in P1 in respect of A motor vehicle imported solely for private use in respect of which the Letter of Credit (LC) was opened on or before 20.11.2015 and registered the vehicle on or before 31.03.2016 in the name of the person who uses it for his/her private purposes and shall not be transferred for a period of five (05) years from the date of registration without prior approval from the General Treasury..

However, the respondents later realized that there was a business practice in the motor vehicle import trade, for vehicle importers to sometimes establish letters of credit in their own names when they were executing orders placed by customers to import vehicles for the customers personal use. To meet this type of situation the Ministry of Finance issued a notification dated 13th January 2016 marked P5 stating Further, vehicle importers who have imported motor vehicles for personal use on LCs opened before Budget 2016 are permitted to be cleared from the Customs by paying the Duties under the rate prevailed at 20.11.2015, without paying any demurrages.. Thus, P5 clarified that the scope of the Order marked P4 extended to instances where a car had been imported for the personal use of a person under a letter of credit that had been established prior to 20th November 2015 in the name of a vehicle importer. Thereafter, the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury wrote the letter dated 21st January 2016 marked P6 to the 3rd respondent [Director General of Customs]. This letter sets out how a person who is claiming that he is liable to pay Excise Duty at the earlier rate of 5% should demonstrate that the car has, in fact, been imported for his personal use even though the letter of credit is established in the name of a vehicle importer. In this regard, P6 explains that such a person will be entitled pay Excise Duty at only 5% .. if sufficient proof is furnished to the satisfaction of the Director General of Department of Fiscal Policy that the vehicle is imported for such individuals personal use. For this purpose, documentary evidence obtained from a bank that he/she has paid full or partial payment to the importer should be submitted along with the other documents.. In March 2016, the 1st to 6th petitioners submitted applications to the 5th respondent [Director General of the Department of Fiscal Policy] in terms of P6 seeking approval to pay Excise Duty at the earlier rate of 5%. The petitioners submitted the documents marked P7(a) to P7(f) seeking to establish that the cars had been imported for the personal use of the 1st to 6th petitioners and that the 1st to 6th petitioners had paid full or partial payment to the 7th petitioner [ie: to the vehicle importer]. However, by his letters dated 28th March 2016 marked P9A to P9F, the 5th respondent advised the 1st to 6th petitioners that their applications had been refused since the evidence submitted did not substantiate the requirements of P4.",

This burden was particularly difficult in the case of individuals who had imported electric cars for their personal use. In this background, the Cabinet of Ministers has taken the Cabinet Decision dated 06th January 2016 marked R2 that taxes and levies on cars imported under letters of credit established prior to 20th November 2015 should be charged at the rates which prevailed prior to 20th November 2015, provided the car was imported for the official or personal use of the person for whom the car was imported and not for any commercial purpose. It is also evident that the Order dated 11th January 2016 marked P4 was issued a few days later in pursuance of that decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers. Thus, the Order marked P4 stipulated, inter alia, that Excise Duty was to be applied at the earlier rates specified in P1 if the car was imported solely for private use.",

While large scale vehicle importers may have a practice of receiving written orders and entering into written contracts prior to executing orders to import vehicles for the personal use of their customers, small scale vehicle importers who operate more informally may not necessarily obtain such formal documentation. In these circumstances, insisting on the 1st to 6th petitioners submitting written orders and written contracts to pass the hurdle of proving that the cars were imported for their personal use, would amount to imposing an unrealistic and unfair standard of proof upon them. In my view, it is necessary to keep in mind the purpose for which P4, P5 and P6 were issued and the fact that the petitioners were placed in the unexpected situation of being called upon to now produce documentation which they may not have seen any reason to insist on at the time the orders and advance payments were made. In this light, I consider it irrational and improper for the 5th respondent to impose an unrealistically or impractically high standard of proof when dealing with these applications.

A further restriction is placed by prohibiting that person from transferring the car to someone else for a period of five years without prior approval from the General Treasury.

These amounts range from Rs. 500,000/- to Rs.1,600,000/-. The 1st to 6th petitioners are unlikely to have withdrawn such large sums of money from their bank accounts unless the withdrawal was for the specific purpose of making a significant purchase or meeting a financial commitment. These are certainly not amounts which would have been withdrawn for ordinary day-to-day expenses. It has to be also kept in mind that the sums were withdrawn from their bank accounts long prior to any hint of the increase in Excise Duty on 20th November 2015. This lends credence to the 1st to 6th petitioners statements that they withdrew these large sums for the specific purpose of making advance payments to the 7th petitioner.",

With regard to the respondents submission that the receipts should be rejected because they do not bear a printed serial number, I do not think that the absence of a serial number necessarily negates the authenticity of the receipts. It could well be that the 7th petitioner saw no need to print serial numbers on receipts he used. It could also be said that, if the 7th petitioner had intended to fabricate false receipts, he could have easily inserted appropriate serial numbers, and perhaps the fact that this was not done suggests that the receipts are bona fide.",

However, as mentioned earlier, the second requirement specified in P6 is documentary evidence obtained from a bank that the 1st to 6th petitioners had made full or partial payment to the 7th petitioner. Clearly, the letters issued by the bank confirming that the 1st to 6th petitioners withdrew sums of money from their bank account and the receipts issued by the 7th petitioner when these monies were paid to him by the 1st to 6th petitioners [described in (ii) and (iii) above] do not, in themselves, satisfy this requirement - ie: because these receipts have not been issued by a bank. In this regard, in their petition, the petitioners relied on the letters issued by the 7th petitioners bank described in (v) above which confirm that the sums specified in the letters were deposited to the credit of the 7th petitioners bank account and the copies of the face of the deposit vouchers described in (vi) above which record the deposit of these amounts to the 7th petitioners bank account on the dates specified thereon. All these dates are after the aforesaid advance payments were made by the 1st to 6th petitioner. That accords with the petitioners position that their advance payments were deposited by the 7th petitioner in his bank account. However, it is seen that the amounts deposited in the 7th petitioners bank account are all considerably more than the amounts of the advance payments. The advance payments made by the 1st to",
