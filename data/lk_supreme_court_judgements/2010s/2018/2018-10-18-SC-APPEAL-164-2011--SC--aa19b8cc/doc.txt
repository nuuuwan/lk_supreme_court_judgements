SC Appeal 164/2011 and SC Appeal 165/2011 are appeals filed by the Respondent in Labour

Tribunal Case No. 36/19462/2006 which was pending before the Labour Tribunal of

Bandarawela.

The Applicant G. Kothandan who was initially employed by the Agarapathane Plantations

Company, as a Secretary (security) was working as an internal auditor at the time he was sent

on retirement, reaching the age of 55 years. The Applicant, who was not happy with the said

decision of the Respondent, to send him on retirement by reaching 55 years, went before the

Labour Tribunal.

At the conclusion of the inquiry before the Labour Tribunal, the President of the said Labour

Tribunal by his order dated 25.03.2008 directed the Respondent to pay the Applicant one year’s

salary as compensation.

Being dissatisfied with the said decision, both the Applicant and the Respondent had preferred

appeals to the High Court of the Uva Province- holden in Badulla. By his order dated 20.05.2011

the learned High Court Judge had allowed the appeal filed by the Applicant-Appellant and

directed the Respondent-Respondent to pay the Applicant-Appellant 05 years’ salary as

compensation.

The Respondent-Respondent in the said appeal and the Respondent-Appellant in the cross

appeal namely, Agarapathane Plantations Company Limited, being dissatisfied with the said

orders of the High Court of Uva Province, had preferred two Special Leave to Appeal

applications before the Supreme Court.

When the said Special Leave to Appeal applications were supported before this court on

18.10.2011, parties agreed to support only one matter, i.e. SC SPL LA 125/2011 and this court

after considering the matters placed before court in the said application had granted special

leave on the questions of law containing in paragraph 13 (b) (c) (d) and (e) to the effect that;

b) Did the Honourable Judge of the High Court misdirected himself in the

interpretation of the terms and conditions of employment more specifically the

grant of extension of service?

4

c) Did the Honourable Judge of the High Court misdirected himself with regard to

the duty of the workman to mitigate his losses?

d) Did the Honourable Judge of the High Court err in evaluating and analyzing the

provisions of the letter of appointment and circulars applicable in this matter?

e) Did the Honourable Judge of the High Court fail to consider “just and equitable

jurisdiction” vested in the Labour Tribunal?

Since the parties agreed to support only one matter and to abide by the decision in the said

appeal, at the time the leave was granted, question of considering both appeals will not arise at

this stage.

As admitted by both parties before this court the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as Applicant-Respondent) who commenced his career as a secretary

(security) in a lower grade in the year 1992 was subsequently promoted to a post of Assistant

Manager in the year 1995. Parties relied on three main documents during the arguments

before us. The Respondent-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as Respondent-

Appellant) heavily relied on the document marked A-9, whilst the Applicant-Respondent heavily

relied on documents marked A-3 and A-5.

Whilst referring to document A-9 which is the letter of appointment issued to the Applicant-

Respondent when he was promoted as the Assistant Manager in the year 1995 the

Respondent-Appellant argued that, the said letter of appointment categorically provided that

the workman would be automatically retired at the age of 55.

Under clause 11 of the said letter, retirering age of the employee is referred to as follows;

11 retirements: You will stand automatically retired on reaching the age of 55.

Whilst relying on the said document, the Respondent-Appellant further submitted that the

document relied by the Applicant-Respondent, namely A-3 was a document issued in January

1994, one and a half years prior to the issuance of the letter of appointment to the Applicant-

Respondent and therefore A-3 could not supersede the specific conditions set out in the letter

of appointment marked A-9.

5 As a further argument, the Respondent-Appellant had submitted that there is a pre-requisite

for the workman to claim the benefit under paragraph 2 of A-3, and the Applicant-Respondent

is not entitled to claim the said benefit due to his own conduct, by failing to give notice prior to

six months of his retirement date. The Respondent-Appellant denied A-5 and took up the

position that it has no bearing of his employees since it was issued by the State Plantation

Corporation.

Even though I see no merit in the 1st argument of the Respondent-Appellant that A-3 could not

supersede A-9, I would like to go into more detail about the 2nd argument referred to above.

As referred to above in this judgment, the Applicant-Respondent had relied on two documents

A-3 and A-5. A-5 which referred to the outcome of a discussion between the Minister-in-Charge

of the Plantation Industries and some Trade Unions in the same sector, issued by the Sri Lanka

State Plantation Corporation, in October 1991.

In the said document, the extension of the employment beyond the retirering age is referred as

follows;

1.1 ……………explained the following policy that will be adopted in regard to

extensions of service of the workers and the other staff beyond the optional age

of retirement (55 years)

Estate workers- workers will be allowed extensions up to 60 years

Other members of the staff- extension beyond 55 years of age will be given if

the employees work and conduct have been satisfactory and if he is in good

health provided no surplus on the particular grade/s

1.2 Request for extension of service should be made six month prior to the date on

which such extension fall due

Even though the learned President’s Counsel who represented the Respondent-Appellant,

challenged the validity of the above documents with regard to the employees of the

Agarapathane Plantations Limited, it is observed by this court that the decisions referred to in

the said circular with regard to the extension of service beyond 55 years had been adopted by

the Agarapathane Plantations Limited by A-3 dated 06.01.1994. In the said circumstances it is

6 observed by this court that the provisions referred to above will have a bearing on the

employees of the Agarapathane Plantations Limited up to the point it had been adopted by the

Respondent-Appellant Company.

However between the above documents, namely A-3 and A-5, A-3 is the most important one

which has direct bearing on the employees of the Respondent-Appellant Company.

As further observed by this court, document A-5 is more general in its nature, since it refers not

only to the extension of service beyond the age of 55 but also referred to several other issues in

the estate sector but A-3 is a specific document which deals only with the subject, “Extension of

service of employees- beyond 55 years”

Even though the learned President’s Counsel who represented the Respondent-Appellant had

mainly relied on paragraph 2 of the said circular, raising the 2nd objection referred to above, it is

necessary to consider paragraphs 2-5 of the said circular to understand the policy adopted by

the employer by the said circular. In the said circumstances I would like to first reproduce the

paragraphs 2-5 of the circular dated 06.01.1994 which reads as follows;

“It is therefore mandatory on the employees concerned to make applications of their

intention to continue in employment beyond the age of 55 years. Such application

should be made six months prior to reaching 55 years and subsequent applications for

such extensions should also be made annually six months before the expiry of their

current extension.

Irrespective of whether the employee concerned make an application of his intention to

continue in employment, it would be in the interests of the management to give an

employee one year’s notice and also indicate clearly to him the necessity to handover

vacant position of the official quarters occupied by him and any other assets belonging

to the estate in his charge, on or before the date of his/her retirement. In the event, the

management decides to terminate the employment of an employee after he/she

reaches 55 years and it is the intention of the management to limit such extension to

one year only, this should be intimated in writing to the employee together with the

necessity to handover vacant position of the official quarters on or before such date of

retirement.

7

Similarly, in the event of any further extensions beyond one year are granted and

depending on whether or not it is the intention of the management to retire such

employee after each such extension written notice, as appropriate of the managements

intention should be conveyed. This will facilitate the employee, to make alternative

arrangements as regards his/her housing, schooling for his/her children and also plan

for his/her future commitments consequent to retirement.”

Even though there is a mandatory requirement for the employee concerned to make such

application six months in advance, (not followed by the employee in the present case) the next

paragraph of the same circular had provided, in the interest of the management, the

management to give one year’s notice indicating the date on which he has to hand over the

official quarters etc.

As correctly observed by the learned President of the Labour Tribunal, in the absence of such

notice being given, there is a legitimate expectation by the Applicant-Respondent that his

services will be extended for one year when he reaches the age of 55 years, since the

requirement under the above circular had not been followed by the employer giving him notice

that he should vacate the official quarters etc. on completion of 55 years. In the said

circumstances, I observe that the learned President of the Labour Tribunal is correct in granting

compensation of one year’s salary to the Applicant-Respondent.

When the above decision was challenged before the High Court of Provinces holden in Badulla

the learned High Court Judge had decided to increase the compensation to 5 years’ salary

merely for the reason that the appeal has taken more than 4 years and the Applicant-

Respondent has now reached 60 years, and therefore he will not be able to find alternate

employment.

As observed by me the document A-3 or A-5 had not provided an extension of the employment

of an employee who reached the age of 55 years by 05 years. The extension if it to be granted,

will only be for one year and to be considered once again by adhering to all the requirement in

the circular for one more year. In the said circumstances question of granting compensation

computed for 5 years will not arise and therefore I hold that the learned High Court Judge had

erred when he decided to award compensation for a period of 5 years based on his last drawn

salary.

8 I therefore answer the questions of law raised before this court in favour of the Respondent-

Appellant and set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge of the Uva Province dated

20.05.2011 and affirm the order dated 25th March 2008 by the learned President of the Labour

Tribunal Bandarawela.

Appeal allowed no costs.
