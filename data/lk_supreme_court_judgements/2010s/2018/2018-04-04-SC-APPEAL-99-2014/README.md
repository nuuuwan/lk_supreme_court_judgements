Argued on : 12th February, 2018

Decided on : 4th April, 2018

Priyantha Jayawardena PC, J

This is an appeal filed against the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 7th August, 2012

setting aside the order of the learned Judge of the District Court of Mawanella dated 27th April,

2006.

The Plaintiff-Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff)

instituted an action in the District Court against the Defendant-Respondent-Respondent-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant) to have a deed of transfer declared void

and sought the ejectment of the Defendant from the premises. The said Court granted the reliefs

as prayed for in the Plaint.

Thereafter, the Plaintiff made an application to the said court for the execution of the decree to

eject the Defendant from the said premises and accordingly a writ was issued. When the Fiscal

proceeded to the said premises to execute the said writ on 19th September, 2005, he was resisted

by the 3rd Respondent- Petitioner-Respondent and the 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to collectively as the Respondents) claiming to be the owner and the

tenant/lessee of the said premises, respectively.

Thereafter, on 20th October, 2005, the Plaintiff made an application to the District Court in

terms of Section 325(1) of the Civil Procedure Code seeking, inter alia, an order to add the

said Respondents as parties to the application, and to re-issue the writ and fix it for inquiry.

The court ordered the issuance of notices on the said Respondents.

At the inquiry, the said Respondents raised a preliminary objection stating that the application

of the said Plaintiff had been filed out of time, and thus, cannot be maintained. The learned

District Court Judge, by Order dated 27th April, 2006 overruled the said preliminary objection

of the said Respondents stating that the time frame stipulated by Section 325(1) of the Civil

Procedure Code is not a mandatory requirement because of the word may used in the said

section.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the said 3rd Respondent preferred an appeal to the Court of

Appeal and the said Court by its Judgment dated 7th August, 2012 allowed the said Appeal.

5

The Court of Appeal held that the learned Judge of the District Court had erred in law by not

upholding the objection of the Respondents and that the Plaintiffs application which was filed

on 20th October, 2005, under of Section 325(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, was out of time,

as the stipulated time period in the instant application was to be computed from 19th September

and expired on 19th October.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Plaintiff sought leave to

appeal from this court and the leave was granted on the following question of law:

Whether the Court of Appeal erred in law by not applying Section 14(a) of the

Interpretation Ordinance to the facts of this case in as much as Section 325 of the Civil

Procedure Code which specifically uses the word from to express the one month

[time period] from the obstruction or resistance?

Notwithstanding the fact that the notices were sent to the Defendant and the 2nd Respondent,

only the Plaintiff and the 3rd Respondent appeared in this Court. The 3rd Respondent died during

the pendency of the instant application and his heirs were substituted in place and room

(hereinafter referred to as the substituted Respondents).

Submissions by the Plaintiff

The Plaintiff submitted that in terms of Section 14(a) of the Interpretation Ordinance No. 21 of

1901 as amended (hereinafter referred to as the Interpretation Ordinance), the use of the word

from by the Legislature means that the first day of a series of days has to be excluded;

therefore, when calculating the one month period, the date of resistance must be excluded from

the computation. Accordingly, the Plaintiff contended that when calculating the one month

period in the instant appeal, the date of resistance i.e. 19th September, 2005 must be excluded

and time runs from 20th September, 2005.

The Plaintiff further submitted that Section 2(o) of the Interpretation Ordinance defines a

month as a calendar month, unless words be added showing lunar months to be intended. As

such, after excluding the date of resistance, the calendar month in this application commences

from 20th September, 2005. Therefore, the date on which the application was filed i.e. 20th

October, 2005 falls within the prescribed time.

6

The Plaintiff further submitted that the word within used in Section 325(1) allows anyone to

file an application on the numerically corresponding day of the next month.

The Plaintiff referred to the following judgments in support of her argument. In Silva v

Upasena SC/FR Application No. 472/96 Supreme Court Minutes, it was observed that one

month should be computed from 30th April to 30th May with regard to Article 126 of the

Constitution which states that fundamental rights applications must be filed within one month

of the date of violation. Further, in Hewakuruppu v Tea Commissioner SC/FR Application No.

118/84 Supreme Court Minutes, it was held that if the violation occurred on 13th July, 1984,

the application ought to have made on or before 13th August, 1984.

Submissions by the substituted Respondents

The said Respondents submitted that when the word within is used, the relevant papers must

be filed in court before the stipulated time period lapses and it is not possible to file an

application on the last day.

The Respondents relied on the case of Hare v Gocher (1962) 2 QB 641 wherein it was held:

From that same point of time there is to be calculated for the purpose of Section

14 of the [Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act of 1960], a period of

two months beginning with August 29th, 1960 and it appears to me, and I would

hold, that such a period expired at midnight on October 28, 1960. Accordingly,

hard as it may be for the Defendant, he was 12 hours late when he delivered his

application at noon on the following day, October 29th, 1960.

The Respondents further submitted that according to the above authority and the definition

given to the word month in Websters Collegiate Dictionary 10th Edition, a calendar month

consists of 30 days. When the said definition is applied, the instant application which was filed

on 20th October, 2005 is out of time by one day as the one month period expired at midnight

on 19th October, 2005. Therefore, even if the contention of the Plaintiff is accepted by Court,

her application is still out of time by one day.

Further, the word from used in Section 325(1) of the Civil Procedure Code does not exclude

the day of resistance.

7

Did the Plaintiff file her application within the prescribed period?

The question of law that needs to be considered in this appeal is whether, in terms of Section

325(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, the Plaintiff had made an application to the District Court

within the stipulated time.

Section 325(1) of the Civil Procedure Code states thus:

Where in the execution of a decree for the possession of movable or immovable

property the Fiscal is resisted or obstructed by the Judgment-Debtor or any other

person, or where after the officer has delivered possession, the judgement-creditor

is hindered or ousted by the judgement-debtor or any other person in taking

complete and effectual possession thereof, and in the case of immovable property,

where the judgment-creditor has been so hindered or ousted within a period of one

year and one day, the judgment- creditor may at any time within one month from

the date of such resistance or obstruction or hindering or ousting complain thereof

to the court by a Petition [Emphasis added]

Hence, Section 325(1) requires a Petition to be filed within one month from the date of

resistance or similar act.

In the instant case, the Fiscal was resisted from executing the writ on 19th September, 2005 and

the application was filed on 20th October, 2005. Therefore, this court is called upon to decide

whether the application filed on 20th October 2005, is out of time in terms of Section 325(1).

At the time of the hearing, the parties made submissions on the following words in the said

section and invited the court to interpret the same:

a. within;

b. one-month; and,

c. from the date of resistance.

Therefore, this court is now called upon to consider the words within one month from the date

of resistance referred to in Section 325 of the Civil Procedure Code in order to ascertain

whether the application was filed within the stipulated time.

Effect of the word within

Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Ed, page 309 states:

Where the statute prescribes some period of days or weeks or months or

years within which some act has to be done, although the computation of

the period in every case depends on the intention of Parliament as gathered

from the statute, generally the first day of the period will be excluded from

the reckoning, and consequently the last day will be included.

A complaint under Section 14 of the Cruelty to Animals Act No.1849, U.K.

had to be made within one calendar month after the cause of the complaint

shall arise. It was held that an information preferred on June 30, 1891

alleging ill-treatment of a certain sheep on the preceding May 30 was laid

in time (Radcliffe v Bartholomew [1892] 1 QB 161).

Venkataramaiyas Law Lexicon with Legal Maxims. 2nd Ed, Vol 4 states as follows:

The word within whether legal or otherwise, can only mean at any time

before the fixed date. The word within means on or before.

I am of the opinion that when interpreting a time frame given to an aggrieved party to apply to

a court or lodge an appeal in respect of a matter that affects his or her rights, the courts should

not interpret such legislation in a way that deprives a litigant from accessing justice. The right

to access justice hails back to the Magna Carta of 1215 and I am of the opinion that the

Legislature had not intended to curtail a litigants rightful recourse to justice. In light of this,

such legislation should be given a liberal interpretation.

The same approach has been adopted in several cases. In Silva v Sankaram [2002] 2 SLR 209,

it was held:

The phrase within 60 days from the date of judgment or decree,

encompasses a limited time span. In Blacks Law Dictionary the word

within when used in relation to time, has been defined as meaning any

time before, at or before, at the end of, before the expiration of, not beyond,

not exceeding, not later than. The use of the word within as a time or limit,

or degree or space, embraces the last day or degree or entire distance

covered by the time fixed.

9

Further, in Okolo v Secretary of State for the Environment [1997] 2 All ER 911 at 916, it was

held:

I prefer the view, corresponding with both colloquial usage and legal

principle, that six weeks beginning on a Tuesday end six Tuesdays later, and

that an act done on the final Tuesday is therefore an act done within the six

weeks. [Emphasis added]

A contrary view was taken in Hare v Gocher (1962) 2 QB 641, wherein the Court held that

where a period of two months began on 29th August 1960, the time period expired on 28th

October, 1960.

It is evident that the preposition within used in Section 325(1) of the Civil Procedure Code

should be interpreted to include the last day of the stipulated time frame when computing the

time period within which an act is required to be carried out.

Thus, I am of the opinion that in view of the usage of the word within, an application can

be filed on or before the last day of the stipulated time frame set out in Section 325(1) of the

Civil Procedure Code.

Effect of the phrase one month

Section 2(o) of the Interpretation Ordinance defines the term month as a calendar month,

unless words be added showing lunar months to be intended.

As Section 325(1) does not make specific reference to a lunar month, in this context one

month should be interpreted to mean one calendar month.

I am of the opinion that a calendar month should be calculated from a day in a specific month

to the numerically corresponding day in the following month. Therefore, in this application, if

time starts to run on 20th September 2005, the final date to file the application will be 20th

October 2005.

Strouds Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases, 6th Ed, Vol 1, page 366 states:

So, of a complaint, which has to be made within one calendar month after

its cause; and, therefore, where in such a case the alleged offence be on May

30, the complaint is in time on June 30

10

In Burne v Munisamy 21 NLR 193 held that where notice of intention to quit was given on June

11 and which date was excluded from the computation, the calendar month expired at midnight

on July 11.

In Ceylon Estates Staffs Union v Superintendent, Pallekelle State Plantation [1984] 1 SLR 66,

it was held:

Section 2(p) of the Interpretation Ordinance defines month to mean a

calendar month, unless words be added showing lunar month to be intended.

. It is equally well established that when the relevant period is a month or a

specified number of months after the giving of the notice the general rule is

that the period ends on the corresponding date in the subsequent month, i.e. the

day of that month that bears the same number as day of the earlier month on

which the notice was given.

Effect of the word From

At the time of hearing, the parties conceded that although the present appeal is regarding an

inquiry under Section 325 of the Civil Procedure Code, Section 14(a) of the Interpretation

Ordinance applies to inquiries. Accordingly, I shall not consider the applicability of Section

14(a) to the instant application.

Section 14(a) of the Interpretation Ordinance defines the term from as follows:

for the purpose of excluding the first in a series of days or any period of

time, it shall be deemed to have been and to be sufficient to use the word

from.

I am of the opinion that whenever the Legislator used the word from the date of an occurrence

of an event, such date should be excluded when computing time. The effect of the word from

in calculating time frames when used in legislation was considered in Burne v Munisamy

(supra) where it was held that;

in pursuance to the general rule with regard to the computation of time

as well as the positive enactment of Section 9(1) of the Interpretation

11

Ordinance, 1901, the day from which the time runs must be excluded, and

the day for the act to be done must be included. (Emphasis added)

In Sivapadasundaram v Pathmaden [2004] BASL Journal 89 at 90, the Court held that;

Our courts in many instances have considered the provisions of both sections

mentioned above, and interpreted the words from the date of the judgment

contained in Section 755(3) of the Civil Procedure Code. When computing

60 days from the date of the judgment, the date of pronouncement of the

judgment should be excluded

I agree with the ratio decidendi of the aforementioned judgments and hold that when the

Legislator used the word from, the date of the occurrence should be excluded when

computing the time period.

Conclusion

In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that:

(a) the word from means that time begins to run on the day after the date of resistance;

(b) the phrase one month denotes a calendar month which should be calculated from a

specific day in a month to the numerically corresponding day in the following month; and,

(c) the word within should be interpreted to include the last day of the stipulated time frame

within which an act is required to be performed.

Therefore, I am of the view that the day the Fiscal was resisted must be excluded from the

computation of the one month period specified under Section 325(1) of the Civil Procedure

Code and accordingly, time starts to run from 20th September, 2005. Thus, the learned Judge

of the Court of Appeal has erred in concluding that the one month period in the instant

application commenced on 19th September, 2005.

Further, I am of the opinion that the one month period stipulated by Section 325(1) is a calendar

month starting from 20th September, 2005 to 20th October, 2005. As such, I hold that the

application made on 20th October, 2005 is valid in law as the one month period stipulated by

the said section shall be calculated inclusive of the last day of the given time frame.

12

Thus, I am unable to agree with the submissions of the substituted Respondents. Further, I

agree with the submissions of the Plaintiff. Accordingly, I allow the appeal and set aside the

judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 7th August, 2012 and the Order of the District Court

dated 27th April, 2006.

No costs.
