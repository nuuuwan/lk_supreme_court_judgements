Dharmashoka College is an old established National School with a reputation for good academic results and extra-curricular excellence. Many parents who reside in the Ambalangoda region are anxious to admit their children to Dharmashoka College, in the hope that an education at that institution will stand their children in good stead. This results in fierce competition among those parents to secure admission of their children to Grade 1 of the school each year. In HULANGAMUWA vs. SIRIWARDENA, PRINCIPAL, VISAKHA VIDYALAYA [1986 1 SLR 275 at p.281], Siva Selliah J described this competition among parents as the annual \u201cscramble for admission\u201d. More than three decades later, this competition continues unabated. If at all, it has heightened.",

Nevertheless, these Circulars aim at achieving the best possible framework for admission of students to Grade 1 of all government schools each year and are, from time to time, refined and revised by the lessons learnt from the experiences of each year.

    "text": "category has been rounded up to 8; and the fraction of 1.98 in the \u201cReturned from abroad\u201d category has been rounded up to 10. However, the numbers calculated and stated by the petitioners in respect of the \u201cBrothers/ Sisters\u201d category and the \u201cStaff members under the Ministry of Education\u201d category are wrong. The correct numbers for these two categories are 29.7 and 9.9 respectively [15% of 198 is 29.7 and 5% of 198 is 9.9]. Thus, the aforesaid table prepared and pleaded by the petitioners is misleading. When this error is corrected, it is seen that the rounding up of the fractions in all the categories was correct and reasonable since the elementary arithmetical rule is that fractions higher than five are to be rounded up to the nearest integer and fractions lower than five are to be rounded down to the nearest integer. Thus: 29.7 has been correctly rounded up to 30 in the \u201cBrothers/ Sisters\u201d category; 9.9 has been correctly rounded up to 10 in the \u201cStaff members under the Ministry of Education\u201d category; 7.92 has been correctly rounded up to 8 in the \u201cTransferred Public Servants\u201d category; and 1.98 has been correctly rounded up to 2 in the \u201cReturned from abroad\u201d category, respectively. When, during the course of submissions, we observed that the aforesaid table prepared by the petitioners was incorrect and misleading, learned counsel for the petitioners apologised and stated that it was an inadvertent mistake. While I accept that there was no intention to mislead, I nevertheless stress that this type of mistake is unacceptable. Care must be taken by those who draft pleadings to ensure that they do not present a misleading picture to Court. With regard to the \u201cpast students category\u201d under which the petitioners have applied, the applicable percentage of 25% resulted in the number 49.50 [25% of 198 is exactly 49.50]. The arithmetical rule is that a fraction of .50 may be rounded up or down, as is suitable in the circumstances. As mentioned earlier, the maximum number of students who could be admitted was 198 and, as explained earlier, 149 students had to be admitted under the other categories - ie: 99 + 30 + 10 + 8 + 2 = 149. As a result, the maximum number of students who could be admitted under the \u201cpast students category\u201d was 49 - ie: 198 - 149 = 49. Thus, the respondents\u2019 determination that the number of students to be admitted under the \u201cpast students category\u201d is to be fixed at 49, is arithmetically sound and is reasonable since the circumstances required that 49.5 be rounded down to 49 so as to ensure that the maximum number of 198 was not breached. There has been no unfair discrimination against applications under that category. Thus, there is no merit in the first ground on which the petitioners rely.",

The factual position is that the 2nd petitioner was placed second on the `Final Waiting List\u2019 at the time \u201cP10(a)\u201d was issued. Further, although \u201cP10(a)\u201d mentions a letter dated 21st May 2015 by which the Principal of Dharmashoka College has referred to a \u201cpossibility\u201d [\u201c\u0dc4\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0d9a\u0dca\u201d] of awarding a further 02 marks to the petitioners, that letter has not been produced to us and the petitioners have not sought from this Court a direction that the letter be produced. Therefore, we are unaware of what was said in the alleged letter. The reference in the recommendation marked \u201cP10(a)\u201d to the existence of a \u201cpossibility\u201d of awarding further marks, does not necessarily establish an undertaking by Principal of Dharmashoka College to give those marks. In any event, the Principal is not entitled to award any marks other those permitted by the Circular marked \u201cP2\u201d and, in the case of applications made under the \u201cpast students category\u201d, the marking scheme marked \u201c10R4\u201d. Further, in cases of doubt with regard to the interpretation or implementation of the Circular marked \u201cP2\u201d, the question is to be referred to the Secretary to the Ministry in terms Clauses 18 and 11.10 of \u201cP2\u201d. However, as learned Senior State Counsel submitted when this application was argued, neither the Secretary nor his representative were made a party to the proceedings before the Human Rights Commission. In these circumstances, I do not think that the petitioners can sustain their submission that the respondents should be held to an alleged undertaking given before the Human Rights Commission.",
