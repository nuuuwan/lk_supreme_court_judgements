    "text": "established that, over the 60 years or more since then, this soap gained much popularity and has become a well-known and widely used product in Sri Lanka. It is clear that, from 1947 onwards, the plaintiff has submitted applications to register several trade marks which are devices containing the word \u201cRani\u201d or \u201cRani\u201d Sandalwood Soap\u201d. Gazette notifications with depictions of some of the trade marks which the plaintiff has applied to register, were produced at the trial marked \u201cP5a\u201d to \u201cP5e\u201d. These documents show that: in 1947, the plaintiff applied to register trade mark no. 10,297 consisting of the words \u201cRANI SANDALWOOD SOAP \u201d placed within an oval device; in 1962, the plaintiff applied to register trade mark no. 24,199 consisting of the word \u201c\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0dab\u0dd2\u201d below a crown; in 1963, the plaintiff applied to register trade mark no. 24,399 consisting of the word \u201c\u0db8\u0dc4\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0dab\u0dd2\u201d below a crown; in 1964, the plaintiff applied to register trade mark no. 25,635 consisting of the word \u201cRani\u201d in a distinctively stylized and bold font in which the capital letter \u201cR\u201d ends with an elongated flourish, placed within a device of an ornate crest topped by a crown; and, on 30th June 2000, the plaintiff applied to register trade mark no. 98653 which is a device consisting of an ornate crest topped by a crown with a picture of a woman\u2019s face within the crest and the word \u201cRani\u201d in the same distinctively stylized and bold font in which the capital letter \u201cR\u201d ends with an elongated flourish, appearing below the crest together with some descriptive words. The plaintiff also produced, marked \u201cP7a\u201d to \u201cP7h\u201d, specimens of soap boxes used by the plaintiff, since the 1940s, to market its \u201cRani\u201d Sandalwood Soap. However, it appears that, although the plaintiff has applied to register the aforesaid trade marks, the plaintiff does not state that any of these trade marks have, in fact, been subsequently registered. In any event, these documents produced by the plaintiff establish that, at least from 1964 onwards, the plaintiff has been using trade marks which consist of a device with the word \u201cRani\u201d in the aforesaid distinctively stylized and bold font in which the capital letter \u201cR\u201d ends with an elongated flourish, together with an ornate crest topped by a crown. There have been some variations to this device from time to time - in particular, the introduction of a picture of a woman\u2019s face - but the continuing and distinct pattern has been the consistent use of the word \u201cRani\u201d in the aforesaid distinctively stylized and bold font in which the capital letter \u201cR\u201d ends with an elongated flourish, together with the device of an ornate crest topped by a crown. The plaintiff states that it has used this \u201cTrade Mark `Rani\u2019 \u201d for many years and has claimed that consumers identify and associate this trade mark with the plaintiff. The 1st defendant is the proprietor of a Grinding Mill in Matale. His business was registered in 1980. He makes and markets packets of curry powder and packets of spices. These facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff says that, in September 2002, the Director of Intellectual Property published a notification marked \u201cP9\u201d stating that the 1st defendant had applied for registration of a trade mark no. 98930. The trade mark which the 1st defendant applied to register, is a",

The plaintiff states that, therefore, it intends to oppose the registration of trade mark no. 98930. The plaintiff states that, the 1st defendant had made another application no. 93987 to register a similar trade mark and that the plaintiff intends to oppose that registration too. The plaintiff goes on to say that, its investigations unearthed the further discovery that, the 1st defendant had earlier successfully registered trade mark no. 93988 marked \u201cP10a\u201d consisting of a device which has the word \u201cRani\u201d with the words \u201cThe Flavour of Lanka\u201d. The plaintiff states that, this device \u201cvisually and phonetically resembles\u201d the device used in the plaintiff\u2019s aforesaid trade marks. The plaintiff says that it did not oppose the registration of the trade mark no. 93988 because the plaintiff was unaware of the 1st defendant\u2019s application to register that trade mark. The plaintiff then goes on to state that, the investigations carried out by the plaintiff in 2002, \u201crevealed\u201d that, the 1st defendant was marketing various spices and curry powders in packets bearing a device consisting of the word \u201cRani\u201d within a crest which is topped by a crown.

On this basis, the plaintiff pleaded a First Cause of Action that, the 1st defendant \u201cis attempting to pass off his products\u201d as those of the plaintiff and that the 1st defendant is committing \u201can act of unfair competition contrary to honest practices in industrial and commercial matters\u201d and sought the permanent injunction which is prayed for in prayer (c) of the plaint. That is (reproduced verbatim): \u201cA Permanent Injunction restraining the 1st Defendant whether acting by himself and/or through his employees and/or agents and/or otherwise howsoever directly and/or indirectly from manufacturing, marketing and/or selling products under the brand name `Rani\u2019 and/or the Rani logo/device used by the Plaintiff Company.\u201d. In prayer (c) of the plaint in Sinhala, the plaintiff has used the Sinhala words \u201c `\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0dab\u0dd2\u2019 \u0dba\u0db1 \u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dca\u0d9c \u0db1\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dba \u201d as having the same meaning as the words \u201cthe brand name `Rani\u2019 \u201d used in prayer (c) of the plaint in English. I doubt the words \u201c\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dca\u0d9c \u0db1\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dba\u201c are an appropriate translation for the term and concept of a \u201cbrand name\u201d [see the Glossary of Technical Terms \u2013 Law, published by the Educational Publications Department and also Malalasekera\u2019s English-Sinhala Dictionary].

On these grounds, the plaintiff prayed for a declaration that, the registration of trade mark no. 93988 in the name of the 1st defendant, was a nullity. The 1st defendant and 2nd defendant both filed their answers. These answers were filed after the Intellectual Property Act No. 36 of 2003 came into effect and the Code of Intellectual Property Act No.52 of 1979 was repealed. As required by section 208 (4) (c) of the Intellectual Property Act No. 36 of 2003, the present case was decided under the provisions of that Act. In his answer, the 1st defendant has specifically pleaded that, the plaintiff does not have an exclusive right to the use of the name \u201cRani\u201d and that the 1st defendant too is entitled to use the name \u201cRani\u201d on his products \u2013 \u201c\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0dab\u0dd3 \u0dba\u0db1 \u0db1\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dba \u0db7\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dcf \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd3\u0db8\u0dda \u0dc3\u0dda\u0dd6\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dab \u0d85\u0dba\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dba \u0db4\u0dd0\u0db8\u0dd2\u0dab\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0da7 \u0db4\u0db8\u0dab\u0d9a\u0dca \u0dc4\u0dd2\u0db8\u0dd2 \u0db8\u0db1\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dda. \u0db8\u0db8\u0db8 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad\u0dad\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0da7\u0daf \u0d91\u0d9a\u0dd3 \u0db1\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dba \u0db7\u0dcf\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dcf \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd3\u0db8\u0da7 \u0d85\u0dba\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0db8\u0d9a\u0dca \u0d87\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0db6\u0dc0 \u0d94\u0dc4\u0dd4 \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0da7\u0dd3\u201d. The 1st defendant also averred that, he only manufactures and markets packeted spices and that his business activities are limited to the manufacturing and marketing of spices. At the trial, the plaintiff raised 25 issues based on the averments in the plaint and the 1st defendant raised 07 issues based on his answer. The 2nd defendant did not raise issues. The plaintiff led the evidence of a Director of the plaintiff company and produced the documents marked \u201cP1\u201d to \u201cP11b\u201d. The evidence was on the lines of the plaint and set out the plaintiff\u2019s case. Learned counsel for the 1st defendant stated that the plaintiff\u2019s witness would not be cross examined on behalf of the 1st defendant. The 1st defendant did not lead any evidence or produce any documents. The 2nd defendant did not do so either. Thus, as the learned High Court Judge observed in his judgment, the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witness \u201chas not been seriously contested by the 1st Defendant\u201d. When one looks at the device used by the plaintiff in its trade marks for several decades and the device used by the 1st defendant on its packets of \u201cChillie Powder\u201d and \u201cCurry Stuff\u201d marked \u201cP11a\u201d and \u201cP11b\u201d, it is immediately obvious that, there is a distinct and striking resemblance between the devices used by the 1st defendant on his products and the trade marks used by the plaintiff on its products. In fact, when the learned High Court Judge examined the trade marks used by the plaintiff and the impugned devices used by the 1st defendant, the learned judge observed. in his judgment, that, there was \u201ca glaring similarity\u201d. The learned trial judge was of the view that, this similarity between the trade marks could mislead the public into thinking that the 1st defendant\u2019s products are associated with the plaintiff and its products. On that basis, the learned trial judge held, with regard to the plaintiff\u2019s First Cause of Action, that the 1st defendant was attempting to pass off his",

Therefore, the High Court issued the aforesaid permanent injunction prayed for in prayer (c) of the plaint restraining the 1st defendant from \u201cmanufacturing, marketing and/or selling products under the brand name `Rani\u2019 and/or the Rani logo/device used by the Plaintiff Company.\u201d With regard to the plaintiff\u2019s Second Cause of Action seeking a declaration of nullity of the registration of trade mark no. 93988, the learned trial judge held that, there was a similarity between trade mark no. 93988 and the plaintiff\u2019s trade marks and that, as a result, the provisions of section 104 (1) (d) of the Intellectual Property Act made trade mark no. 93988, inadmissible for registration. On that basis, the learned judge issued the declaration prayed for in the plaint, declaring the registration of trade mark no. 93988, to be a nullity. The 1st defendant appealed to this Court against the judgment and prayed that the judgment of the High Court be set aside. At this point, it should be stated that, the aforesaid wording of the permanent injunction prayed for in prayer (c) of the plaint and issued by the High Court, makes it clear that this Order imposes a twofold prohibition on the 1st defendant. These two types of prohibitions are separated by the words \u201cand/or\u201d which occur between the words \u201cunder the brand name `Rani\u2019\u201d and the words \u201cthe Rani logo/device used by the Plaintiff Company.\u201d in the permanent injunction. Thus, the first limb of the permanent injunction restrains the 1st defendant from \u201cmanufacturing, marketing and/or selling products under the brand name `Rani\u2019\u2026.\u201d. The second limb of the permanent injunction restrains the 1st defendant from \u201cmanufacturing, marketing and/or selling products under \u2026.. the Rani logo/device used by the Plaintiff Company.\u201d [emphasis added by me]. When the appeal was taken up before us, learned President\u2019s Counsel appearing for the 1st defendant stated that: (i) the 1st defendant agrees and undertakes not to use, on its products, the font used by the plaintiff in the word \u201cRani\u201d contained in the plaintiff\u2019s trade marks; and (ii) the 1st defendant agrees and undertakes not to use the device used by the plaintiff - which must include an agreement and undertaking not to use the device of the crest which is topped by a crown, used by the plaintiff, with or without the word \u201cRani\u201d; and (iii) the 1st defendant will not use the device of a crown. Learned President\u2019s Counsel went on to state that, the 1st defendant confines his appeal to the contention that, the plaintiff is not entitled to the exclusive right to use the word \u201cRani\u201d. Consequently, the written submissions filed on behalf of the 1st defendant state (verbatim): 13. However, at the commencement of the submissions before Your Lordship\u2019s Court the counsel for 1st Defendant reduced the scope of the submissions on the basis that,",

Therefore, the second limb of the permanent injunction will prohibit the 1st defendant from using devices which are the same or similar to the several trade marks of the plaintiff which were produced at the trial, which contain the word \u201cRani\u201d in the aforesaid distinctively stylized and bold font in which the capital letter \u201cR\u201d ends with an elongated flourish, together with the device of an ornate crest topped by a crown. It is apparent from the undertaking given by learned President\u2019s Counsel appearing for the 1st defendant and his written submissions that, the 1st defendant does not challenge the second limb of the permanent injunction issued by the High Court. As stated earlier, the High Court issued the permanent injunction following the learned judge\u2019s determination that, the similarity between the marks used by the 1st defendant and the marks used by the plaintiff, was likely to mislead the public into thinking that the 1st defendant\u2019s products are associated with the plaintiff and its products. Since the 1st defendant does not challenge the second limb of the permanent injunction, there is no need for us to examine the learned trial judge\u2019s conclusion that, the similarity between the two trade marks used by the plaintiff and the 1st defendant was likely to mislead the public into thinking that the 1st defendant\u2019s products are associated with the plaintiff and its products even though the type and nature of the products are very different to each other and, to use the words of Falconer J in LEGO SYSTEM vs. LEGO M. LEMELSTRICH [1983 FSR 155 Ch. D], the \u201cfield of activity\u201d and the \u201cfield of recognition\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s products and the 1st defendant\u2019s products, appear to be very different to each other.",

    "text": "1st defendant\u2019s goods and the plaintiff does not own a registered trade mark, in terms of section 104 (1) (d) of the Intellectual Property Act. It follows that, only the aforesaid first limb of the permanent injunction - restraining the 1st defendant from \u201cmanufacturing, marketing and/or selling products under the brand name `Rani\u2019\u2026.\u201d [emphasis by me] - remains a bone of contention in this appeal. It is also evident that, the only question which has to be decided by us is whether the permanent injunction restraining the 1st defendant from \u201c\u2026.. manufacturing, marketing and/or selling products under the brand name `Rani\u2019 and/or the Rani logo/device used by the Plaintiff Company.\u201d, prohibits the 1st defendant from using the word or name \u201cRani\u201d, in any form or manner, on the 1st defendant\u2019s products of whatever type. In this regard, as stated earlier, learned President\u2019s Counsel appearing for the defendant has submitted that, the plaintiff is not entitled to the exclusive right to use word or name \u201cRani\u201d on its products. In response, during the argument before us, learned President\u2019s Counsel appearing for the plaintiff submitted that, the plaintiff is entitled to the exclusive right to use the word or name \u201cRani\u201d. When this question raised by both learned President\u2019s Counsel is considered, it hardly needs to be said that, not only is \u201cRani\u201d a frequently used first name, it is also a word used in everyday language to refer to a queen. In these circumstances, a question would immediately arise as to whether any person can obtain, a sole and exclusive right to use the word \u201cRani\u201d simpliciter \u2013 ie: an exclusive right to use the word \u201cRani\u201d depicted in any form or manner and `stand-alone\u2019 on that person\u2019s products. In this regard, the well-known rule of both the law of trade marks and also the law relating to `passing off\u2019 is that, in the absence of special circumstances such as, for example, cases where extensive use and nurture have resulted in widespread acceptance that a particular word is indelibly associated with a particular product or, cases where, as observed by Lord Herschell in REDDAWAY vs. BANHAM [1896 AC 199] a word has acquired a \u201csecondary meaning\u201d that it refers to a particular product, no person can acquire a trade mark which confers an exclusive right to use a name or word that is used in ordinary, everyday language and, similarly, no person can, by alleging `passing off\u2019, prevent another from using a name or word that is used in ordinary, everyday language. The principle is that, ordinary words should be available for use by everyone and, therefore, no single manufacturer or trader is permitted to monopolize words which occur in everyday language. In the memorable words of Cozens-Hardy MR in \u201cPERFECTION\u201d: JOSEPH CROSFIELD & SONS APPLICATION [1909 26 RPC 837 at 854] \u201cthe great common of the English language\u201d should be kept open to use by all manufacturers and traders. To illustrate this rule, learned President\u2019s Counsel appearing for the 1st defendant cited the statement made by the Delhi High Court in RHIZOME DISTILLERIES P. LTD vs. PERNOD RICARD S.A.FRANCE [2009 Indlaw DEL 2900 para 24] that, \u201cIt is our analysis that no exclusive or proprietary rights can be claimed by either of the parties before us in respect of the word IMPERIAL which is not only in common parlance to be",

In the same case, Vikramajit Sen J [at para 24] expressed the general rule thus: \u201cThe jural message, therefore, is clear and unequivocal. If a party chooses to use a generic, descriptive, laudatory or common word, it must realize that it will not be accorded exclusivity in the use of such words.\u201d. Thus, it would appear that, in the absence of special circumstances of the nature described earlier, any claim to a right to the exclusive use of the word \u201cRani\u201d as a trade mark, whether under the law relating to trade marks or the law relating to `passing off\u2019, must be limited to a depiction of that word in a manner which is distinctive. It hardly needs to be mentioned here that, the depiction of the word in a distinctive manner may be achieved by the use of a particular font or a particular colour or a particular design or a combination of these elements or, to use the words of Aldous LJ in KONINKLIJKE PHILIPS ELECTRONICS NV vs. REMINGTON CONSUMER PRODUCT [2003 Ch. 159], the use of some \u201ccapricious addition\u201d. But, in the absence of special circumstances of the nature described earlier, no person can obtain an exclusive right to use the word \u201cRani\u201d simpliciter on his products. However, we are not required to further examine the aforesaid question raised by both learned President\u2019s Counsel, since this appeal can be decided on a preliminary question arising from the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings, the issues and the evidence placed before the High Court. In this connection, it is apparent from the aforesaid submissions made by both learned President\u2019s Counsel during the argument before us, that both of them proceed on the basis that, the first limb of the permanent injunction - which restrains the 1st defendant from \u201cmanufacturing, marketing and/or selling products under the brand name `Rani\u2019\u2026.\u201d - has the effect of prohibiting the 1st defendant from using the word or name \u201cRani\u201d depicted in any form or manner and on any product of whatever type. In other words, that the restraint placed on the 1st defendant using \u201cthe brand name `Rani\u2019 \u201d constitutes an unqualified prohibition on the 1st defendant using the word \u201cRani\u201d simpliciter - ie: a bar on the use of the word or name \u201cRani\u201d depicted in any form or manner and whether the word or name \u201cRani\u201d is used in combination with a device or get up or `stand-alone\u2019. However, it must now be examined whether the first limb of the permanent injunction which restrains the 1st defendant from using \u201cthe brand name `Rani\u2019\u2026..\u201d [\u201c`\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0dab\u0dd2\u2019 \u0dba\u0db1 \u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dca\u0d9c \u0db1\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dba\u201d] does, in fact, have the effect of imposing an unqualified prohibition on the 1st defendant using the word \u201cRani\u201d simpliciter. In this regard, it is evident from the wording of the first limb of the permanent injunction, that the restraint is placed on the use of \u201cthe brand name `Rani\u2019...\u201d. Therefore, in order to ascertain the effect of the first limb of the permanent injunction, one must examine what is meant by the term \u201cbrand name\u201d.",

    "text": "In this regard, it seems to me that, in Sri Lanka, the terms \u201cbrand\u201d and \u201cbrand name\u201d are used more often in the corporate, marketing and advertising arenas to denote the totality of the identity and image of an enterprise or company and also sometimes to refer to the totality of the identity and image of a particular product. Thus, a \u201cBrand\u201d has been described as the \u201cknown identity of a company in terms of what products and services they offer and also the essence of what the company stands for in terms of service and other emotional, non-tangible consumer concerns\u201d [D. Antonucci 2014]. Perhaps it could be fairly said that, in Sri Lanka, the terms \u201cbrand\u201d and \u201cbrand name\u201d are often used, in a general way, to denote the composite whole of the ideas, impressions and beliefs in the minds of the public with regard to an enterprise or company or a particular product and not as terms used to refer to specific Intellectual Property rights which are recognised in our Law and are protected by our Law. But, at the same time, it has to be recognised that, there are also instances where the terms \u201cbrand\u201d and \u201cbrand name\u201d are sometimes used, in everyday language, especially in the field of Marketing, to mean or refer to a trade mark, which, it hardly needs to be said, is a type of Intellectual Property recognised in our law. That is reflected in the definition of the word \u201cbrand\u201d by the American Marketing Association which states that a \u201cbrand\u201d is \u201cA name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that identifies one seller\u2019s good or service as distinct from those of other sellers. The legal term for brand is trademark.\u201d. [emphasised added by me] On the same lines, Philip Kotler, the acclaimed teacher and writer on Marketing, states in his work titled \u201cMarketing Management\u201d, a \u201cbrand\u201d is a \u201cname, term, sign, symbol, or design (or a combination of these) intended to identify the goods and services of one seller or group of sellers and to differentiate them from those of the competitor.\u201c. In fact, the Shorter Oxford Dictionary [5th ed.] states the words \u201cBrand name\u201d means \u201ca trade or proprietary name\u201d. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary [6th ed.] defines the word \u201cBrand\u201d as meaning \u201cA word, mark, symbol, design, term or a combination of these, both visual or oral, used for the purpose of identification of some product or service\u201d. That is on much the same lines in meaning and effect with the definition of a trade mark in section 101 of the Intellectual Property Act which states that a \u201c`trade mark\u201d means \u201cany visible sign serving to distinguish the goods of one enterprise from those of another enterprise\u201d and also the description in section 102 (3) of the Act which states \u201cA mark may consist in particular, of arbitrary or fanciful designations, names, pseudonyms, geographical names, slogans, devices, reliefs, letters, numbers, labels, envelopes, emblems, prints, stamps, seals, vignettes, selvedges, borders and edgings, combinations and arrangements of colours and shapes of goods and containers.\u201d. There could also be instances where the terms \u201cbrand\u201d and \u201cbrand name\u201d are used, in everyday language, when the intention is to mean and refer to a \u201ctrade name\u201d of an enterprise within the meaning of section 101 of the Act or, even perhaps, in connection with \u201cact of unfair competition\u201d or a \u201cbusiness identifier other than a mark or a trade name\u201d or an element of the \u201cgoodwill or reputation\u201d of an enterprise etc, as contemplated in Part VIII of the Act.",

    "text": "Next, it is necessary to look at the Intellectual Property Act No. 36 of 2003 to ascertain whether it refers to the terms \u201cbrand\u201d and \u201cbrand name\u201d and whether these terms come within the scope and ambit of the Act. In this regard, the preamble of the Act states that it is an Act which provides for the Law relating to Intellectual Property in Sri Lanka and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. This Act repealed the Code of Intellectual Property Act No. 52 of 1979 which had repealed the Copyright Ordinance, Designs Ordinance, Patents Ordinance, Trade Marks Ordinance, Merchandise Marks Ordinance and all other enactments which created or recognised or regulated Intellectual Property rights in Sri Lanka. Therefore, there is no other legislation in Sri Lanka which creates, recognises or regulates Intellectual Property rights. Unlike its predecessor - the Code of Intellectual Property Act - the present Act does not expressly state that it is a codifying Act. But, it is clear that, the Intellectual Property Act No. 36 of 2003 compendiously sets out the entirety of the statutory law which now prevails in Sri Lanka with regard to Intellectual Property rights. It is evident that, the Intellectual Property Act recognises and provides for and protects an array of specific and identified types of Intellectual Property such as Copyright, Industrial Designs, Patents, Trade Marks, Trade Names and Layout Designs of Integrated Circuits and also provides protection against Unfair Competition and misuse of Geographical Indications. However, the Act does not define or even refer to the term \u201cbrand name\u201d. In particular, the term or concept of a \u201cbrand name\u201d does not figure in Part V and VI of the Act which deals with \u201cMARKS AND TRADE NAMES\u201d and \u201cTRADE NAMES\u201d or in Part VIII of the Act which deals with \u201cUNFAIR COMPETITION AND UNDISCLOSED INFORMATION\u201d which are the areas of Intellectual Property Law which may be connected or relevant to the term and concept of a \u201cbrand name\u201d. Thus, it is seen that, the term and concept of a \u201cbrand name\u201d is not recognised by the Intellectual Property Act. Next, as far as I can ascertain, there are no decisions of the Superior Courts in Sri Lanka which have specifically recognised any rights which may arise from a claim to a \u201cbrand name\u201d independent of rights under a trade mark. It appears that, a similar position is obtains in England where the Law recognises specific rights accruing from recognised types of Intellectual Property such as trade marks, copyrights, patents, designs and goodwill but does not protect the more abstract and larger concept of \u201cbrands\u201d and \u201cbrand names\u201d. Thus, Lewison J in O2 vs. HUTCHISON [2006 ETMR 677 at para 7] observed, \u201cEnglish Law does not, however, protect brands as such. It will protect goodwill (via the law of passing off); trade marks (via trade mark infringement) the use of particular words, sounds and images (via the law of copyright); and configuration of articles (via the law of unregistered design rights) and so on. But to the extent that a brand is greater than the sum of the parts that English law will protect, it is defenceless against the chill wind of competition.\u201d.",

    "text": "In the light of the aforesaid analysis, the resulting conclusion is that, in our Law, the term \u201cthe brand name `Rani\u2019\u2026.\u201d [\u201c `\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0dab\u0dd2\u2019 \u0dba\u0db1 \u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dca\u0d9c \u0db1\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dba\u201d] used in the first limb of the permanent injunction, does not have any specific meaning or effect which is ex facie recognisable simply by the mere use of the term. Therefore, since there is no specific meaning or effect accorded to the term \u201cbrand name\u201d by our Law, it cannot be said that, the first limb of the permanent injunction, which restrains the 1st defendant from using \u201cthe brand name `Rani\u2019...\u201d., ex facie prohibits the 1st defendant from using the word or name \u201cRani\u201d simpliciter. Instead, in order to ascertain the effect of the first limb of the permanent injunction, one has to examine what the plaintiff sought to prohibit when it prayed for a permanent injunction restraining the 1st defendant from using \u201cthe brand name `Rani\u2019\u2026.\u201d and what the High Court intended when it issued that permanent injunction prohibiting the use of the \u201cthe brand name `Rani\u2019\u2026..\u201d.. To do so, it is necessary to examine the pleadings in the plaint, the issues raised by the parties and what was proved at the trial. In this regard, an examination of the plaint shows that, in paragraphs [8], [10], [17], [18], [22], [23], [30], [32], [33] of the plaint, the plaintiff has referred to the applications it has made to register the \u201c`Rani\u2019 Trade mark and Logo\u201d, its prior use of the \u201c`Rani\u2019 Trade mark and the crown logo/device\u201d and the \u201cTrade mark `Rani\u2019\u201d and the \u201cTrade mark `Rani\u2019 & the crown, the logo/device\u201d and the \u201cTrade marks and the logo/device used by the Plaintiff Company to market the `Rani\u2019 Sandalwood Soap\u2026.\u201d. In paragraphs [22] of the plaint, the plaintiff has referred to the plaintiff\u2019s use of the \u201c\u2026.. Trade mark `Rani\u2019 and other associated Marks along with the logo/device of the crown without interruption since the early 1940\u2019s and that the consumers identify and associate the said `Rani\u2019 with the Plaintiff Company and is one of the most recognizable brand names in the country.\u201d. However, the words \u201cthe said `Rani\u2019 in the latter part of paragraph [22] must refer to the \u201cTrade mark `Rani\u2019 used earlier in that paragraph. Thus, it is seen that, the plaintiff has laid claim, in the plaint, to trade marks and has gone on to plead that, consumers identify these trade marks with the plaintiff. It is also seen from the documents produced by the plaintiff that, the trade marks claimed by the plaintiff consist of the word \u201cRani\u201d in a distinctive stylized font in which the capital letter \u201cR\u201d ends with an elongated flourish, together with the device of an ornate crest and a crown. It is very clear that, the word \u201cRani\u201d is only one of the constituent elements of elaborate and distinctive devices which were the plaintiff\u2019s trade marks. Perhaps, it could be rightly said that, the word \u201cRani\u201d is the major element or leading characteristic of the plaintiff\u2019s trade marks. But, it still remains an incontrovertible fact that, the word \u201cRani\u201d is but one element of the plaintiff\u2019s trade marks. Accordingly, it is evident that, in the plaint, the plaintiff has only claimed unregistered trade marks [\u201c\u0dc0\u0dd9\u0dc5\u0db3 \u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4\u201d] which contain the word \u201cRani\u201d used together with several other constituent elements.",

Thus, issue no.

[11] (d) asks \u201cIs the said Rani trade mark and logo device distinctive of Rani Sandalwood soap manufactured and marketed by the Plaintiff Company ?\u201d; issue no. [11] (e) asks \u201cIs the said Rani trade mark and logo device recognized by the public and trade as distinctive specifically of the Rani Sandalwood soap manufactured and marketed by the Plaintiff Company ?\u201d; issue no.

[20] (c) asks \u201cHas the Plaintiff filed several valid applications in respect of the `Rani\u2019 Trade Mark and the crown/Logo device ?\u201d; issue no. [21] asks \u201cIs the `Rani\u2019 Sandalwood Soap a well known mark in Sri Lanka, in the circumstances morefully set out in paragraph 33 of the Plaint ?\u201d and a few more issues on the same lines. Similarly, the 1st defendant raised a specific issue no. [30] which asks \u201cCan the Plaintiff alone get the exclusive right to use the trade mark \u201cRani\u201d ? The learned trial judge has answered all these issues in the affirmative. Thus, it is evident that, when the parties raised their issues, they placed in issue the plaintiff\u2019s claim to trade marks which contain the word \u201cRani\u201d together with several other constituent elements. Next, the affidavit dated 14th July 2004, which contains the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witness, was also to the effect that, the plaintiff is entitled to trade marks which contain the word \u201cRani\u201d and several other constituent elements. Thus, it is very clear from the pleadings in the plaint, the issues and the evidence that, the plaintiff has only pleaded and claimed that it is entitled to several unregistered trade marks which contains the word \u201cRani\u201d used together with several other constituent elements. It is equally evident that, the plaintiff has not pleaded in the plaint or placed in issue or led evidence to the effect that it has an exclusive right to use the word or name \u201cRani\u201d simpliciter - ie: the plaintiff has not claimed an exclusive right to use the word or name \u201cRani\u201d depicted in any form or manner and `stand-alone\u2019 without the devices of the crest and crown used by the plaintiff. Instead, the plaintiff\u2019s case was that, it is entitled to trade marks which contain the word \u201cRani\u201d together with several other constituent elements. Therefore, any reference in the plaint or in prayer (c) of the plaint to the \u201cbrand name `Rani\u2019 \u201d must mean a reference to the trade marks containing the word \u201cRani\u201d together with several other constituent such as the ornate crest and the crown.",

    "text": "To sum up, it is very clear from the pleadings, issues and evidence led at the trial which only referred to and dealt with the plaintiff\u2019s trade marks, that, the plaintiff was only seeking to restrain the 1st defendant from using the word \u201cRani\u201d in a manner which will cause confusion with the plaintiff\u2019s unregistered trade marks produced at the trial, in terms of the provisions of section 160 of Part VIII of the Intellectual Property Act dealing with Unfair Competition. It follows that, since the permanent injunction that has been prayed for in the plaint must be construed in the light of the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings and issues and what the plaintiff proved at the trial and be confined within those boundaries, the plaintiff could only seek, by means of the first limb of the permanent injunction set out in prayer (c) of the plaint, to restrain the 1st defendant from committing acts which were within the scope of the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings and issues and what the plaintiff proved at the trial \u2013 ie: to restrain the 1st defendant from using the word \u201cRani\u201d in a manner which was similar to the plaintiff\u2019s trade marks. Further, since the learned High Court Judge was necessarily obliged to act within the four corners of the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings, issues, what the plaintiff proved at the trial and the Law, when the learned judge decided to issue the permanent injunction prayed for in prayer (c) of the plaint, the learned judge could have only intended, by the first limb of that permanent injunction, to issue an Order restraining the 1st defendant from using the word \u201cRani\u201d in a manner which was similar to the plaintiff\u2019s trade marks - ie: to restrain the use of the word \u201cRani\u201d in the aforesaid bold and distinctive font including the capital letter \u201cR\u201d ending with an elongated flourish with or without the other constituent elements of those trade marks, such as the crest and the crown. There was no cause or reason for the learned High Court Judge to intend to or, for that matter, to even contemplate issuing an Order which had the effect of restraining the 1st defendant from using the word \u201cRani\u201d simpliciter and stand-alone. It appears from the written submissions made on behalf of the plaintiff that, learned President\u2019s Counsel has acknowledged that, the High Court issued the permanent injunction to restrain the 1st defendant from using any devices which are the same as or resemble the plaintiff\u2019s trade marks. Thus, in paragraphs [66] to [74] of his written submissions, learned President\u2019s Counsel has formulated the question \u201cCan the Plaintiff-Respondent Company claim an exclusive right to use the word Rani ?\u201d and in paragraph [74] has concluded \u201c\u2026.. in the circumstances the Plaintiff-Respondent is entitled to claim exclusive rights in respect of the Rani Trademark and logo/device and to restrain the 1st Defendant from using the said Rani Trademark and logo/device.\u201d. Learned President\u2019s Counsel has, correctly, not pressed a claim that the plaintiff has the exclusive right to use the word \u201cRani\u201d simpliciter. In these circumstances, I am of the view that, the intended effect of the first limb of the permanent injunction issued by the High Court, which restrains the 1st defendant from",

However, since the first limb of the permanent injunction contains the words \u201cthe brand name\u201d and fails to use the intended and correct term of \u201cthe trade marks\u201d (which has an immediately obvious meaning and effect in our law), it is necessary to decide the fate of the first limb of the permanent injunction. Either the first limb of the permanent injunction should be deleted as a result of the failure to use the correct term or, despite the lack of technical accuracy arising from the failure to use the proper term in the pleadings, the first limb of the permanent injunction should be amended to bring it in line with the relief the plaintiff intended to seek and the restraint the High Court intended to impose on the 1st defendant and to, thereby, make the first limb of the permanent injunction meaningful under the provisions of the Intellectual Property Act. When deciding this question, one should keep in mind that, as observed earlier, there are instances where the terms \u201cbrand\u201d and \u201cbrand name\u201d are used, in everyday language, when the intention is to mean and refer to a \u201ctrade mark\u201d. It is evident that, this case is one of those instances since, as set out above, it is apparent that, the term \u201cthe brand name\u201d has been loosely used in prayer (c) of the plaint when the intention was to mean and refer to the plaintiff\u2019s trade mark. Next, one should also look at the circumstances of the case to decide which consequence should follow in the interests of justice and in conformity with the Law. In this regard, this Court must take into consideration the fact that, the 1st defendant has voluntarily given the aforesaid three undertakings and, therefore, will not suffer any prejudice as a result of a correction of the error in the wording of prayer (c) of the plaint. Further, there is no doubt that, the plaintiff has proved its rights to the trade marks produced at the trial and also that, at the trial, the 1st defendant did not dispute the plaintiff\u2019s rights to those trade marks. It is also appears to me that, the use of the words \u201cthe brand name `Rani\u2019\u2026.\u201d in prayer (c) of the plaint after the plaintiff consistently used the term \u201ctrade marks\u201d in the plaint, issues and also in the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witness, is likely to have been an inadvertent error. Paragraph [74] of the plaintiff\u2019s written submissions, which was referred to earlier, supports this view. In these circumstances, I do not think it is fitting to simply delete the first limb of the permanent injunction and, thereby, cause significant prejudice to the plaintiff due to what appears to be an inadvertent error in the wording of prayer (c) of the plaint. Instead, I think it fitting to amend the first limb of the permanent injunction to bring it in line with the relief the plaintiff intended to seek and the restraint the High Court intended to impose on the 1st defendant and to, thereby, make the first limb of the permanent injunction meaningful under the provisions of the Intellectual Property Act.",

To clarify further, the permanent injunction does not impose a restraint on the 1st defendant using the word or name \u201cRani\u201d simpliciter - ie: it does not impose an unqualified prohibition on the 1st defendant using the word \u201cRani\u201d provided the 1st defendant does not violate the prohibitions placed by the permanent injunction, as amended. The aforesaid determination of the effect of the first limb of the permanent injunction issued by the High Court together with the three undertakings given by the 1st defendant and the fact that the 1st defendant does not challenge the second limb of the permanent injunction issued by the High Court and the declaration of nullity issued by the High Court, resolve this appeal. This appeal is allowed only to the extent that, the judgment of the High Court is varied by the amendment of the permanent injunction in the manner set out above. All other reliefs granted by the High Court to the plaintiff shall remain in force, without any change. The High Court is directed to amend the decree accordingly. The 1st defendant shall abide by the undertakings given on his behalf that the 1st defendant will not use on his products: (i) the font used by the plaintiff in the word \u201cRani\u201d contained in the plaintiff\u2019s trade marks; (ii) the device of the crest which is topped by a crown, used by the plaintiff; and (iii) any depiction of a crown. In the circumstances of this case, parties will bear their own costs. Judge of the Supreme Court.",
