This is an appeal against the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court dated

25.3.2014 wherein the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court dismissed

the appeal on the ground that 3rd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent who is a

necessary party had not been brought before court by the Plaintiff-Appellant-

Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff-Appellant) when he

filed the appeal in the Civil Appellate High Court.

The Plaintiff-Appellant filed action against the 1st and the 2nd Defendant-

Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 1st and the 2nd Defendant-

Respondents) seeking a declaration of title to the land described in the schedule to

4

the amended plaint. Later on an application made by the 2nd Defendant-

Respondent, the 3rd Defendant-Respondent was added as a party (the 3rd

Defendant). The learned District Judge by his judgment dated 24.11.2004 decided

that the 3rd Defendant-Respondent is entitled to Lot No.1 of Plan No.2964/w dated

14.5.2001 of DB Wijesinghe Licensed Surveyor. The learned District Judge also

granted the relief claimed in paragraphs (a),(b) and (c) of the prayer to the answer

of the 1st and 2nd Defendants. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned

District Judge, the Plaintiff-Appellant appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court

but failed to name the 3rd Defendant as a party in the Petition of Appeal filed in the

Civil Appellate High Court. The learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court

dismissed the appeal on the ground that the 3rd Defendant-Respondent who is a

necessary party had not been named as a party in the Petition of Appeal. Being

aggrieved by the said judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court, the Plaintiff-

Appellant has appealed to this court. This court by its order dated 17.12.2014,

granted leave to appeal on questions of law set out in paragraphs 25(a),(b),(c),(d)

and (e) of the Petition of Appeal dated 3.5.2014 which are set out below.

a. Did the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal err in holding that if the

Petitioner's action is dismissed it would prejudicially affect the rights

of the 3rd Defendant-Respondent?

b. Did the learned Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal fail to take

cognizance of the case of Ibrahim Vs Beebee ( 19 NLR 289) ?

c. Did the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal err in holding that the

3rd added Defendant was a necessary party to the adjudication of the

Appeal ?

d. Did the learned Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal fail to take

cognizance of Sections 759(2) and 770 of the Civil Procedure Code

5

and thereby failed to add the 3rd Defendant-Respondent as a party to

the Appeal ?

e. Did the learned Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal fail to take

cognizance of and follow the judicial precedent of Your Lordships'

Curt in Ediriweera Jayasekara V Willorage Rasika Lakmini ( 2010 (1)

SLR 41?

Learned counsel for Plaintiff-Appellant contended that it was not necessary to

name the 3rd Defendant-Respondent in the plaint as no relief claimed against him.

She therefore contended that the 3rd Defendant-Respondent is not a necessary party

to the appeal. I now advert to this contention. Although learned counsel for the

Plaintiff-Appellant contended so, the Plaintiff-Appellant in his Petition of Appeal

filed in the Civil Appellate High Court has sought to set aside the judgment of the

learned District Judge dated 24.11.2004 and to grant relief as prayed for in the

amended plaint. She contended that no relief was sought against the 3rd Defendant

in the amended plaint. It has to be noted here that the learned District Judge by his

judgment dated 24.11.2004, has granted relief to the 3rd Defendant-Respondent. If

the Civil Appellate High Court decided to set aside the judgment of the learned

District Judge, then the decision of the Civil Appellate High Court would have set

aside the relief granted to the 3rd Defendant-Respondent by the learned District

Judge. Therefore if the 3rd Defendant-Respondent was made a party to the appeal

filed in the Civil Appellate High Court, he would have defended the judgment of

the learned District Judge and would have resisted the relief claimed in the Petition

of Appeal. Therefore it appears that the aforementioned failure was a deliberate act

by the Plaintiff-Appellant. The conduct of the Plaintiff-Appellant must also be

considered. He is a person who did not name the 3rd Defendant in the plaint. I have

6

earlier observed that the failure of the Plaintiff-Appellant to name the 3rd

Defendant in the plaint was a deliberate act on the part of the Plaintiff-Appellant.

This is further established by his conduct. When I consider all the above matters, I

hold the view that the 3rd Defendant-Respondent is a necessary party to the appeal

filed in the Civil Appellate High Court.

When the aforementioned failure on the part of the Plaintiff-Appellant was brought

to the notice of court, the Plaintiff-Appellant took up the position that if the Civil

Appellate High Court decides that the 3rd Defendant-Respondent is a necessary

party, the court has the power to notice the 3rd Defendant-Respondent. The

Plaintiff-Appellant however did not make an application to court to add the 3rd

Defendant-Respondent as a party. For the above reasons, I am unable to conclude

that the failure on the Plaintiff-Appellant to name the 3rd Defendant-Respondent as

a party to the appeal filed in the Civil Appellate High Court was a mistake or an

omission. If it is a mistake or an omission, the Plaintiff-Appellant should have

made an application to the Civil Appellate High Court to add the 3rd Defendant-

Respondent as a party to the appeal. For the above reasons, I hold that

aforementioned failure was a deliberate act by the Plaintiff-Appellant.

Section 759(2) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows.

In the case of any mistake, omission or defect on the part of any appellant in

complying with the provisions of the foregoing sections, the Court of Appeal

may, if it should be of opinion that the respondent has not been materially

prejudiced, grant relief on such terms as it may deem just.

I have earlier concluded that failure on the part of the Plaintiff-Appellant to name

the 3rd Defendant-Respondent as a party to the appeal filed in the Civil Appellate

7

High Court was deliberate act. Therefore the said failure cannot be considered as a

mistake or an omission or a defect. Thus Section 759(2) of the Civil Procedure

Code has no application to the facts of this case.

In Jayasekara Vs Lakmini and Others [2010] 1SLR 41, this court observed the

following facts.

The 4th defendant-appellant failed to name the 1st and 2nd defendants in the

District Court in the partition action as the respondents in the appeal - only the

plaintiff was made a party. On the objection raised by the plaintiff-appellant

that the appeal is not property constituted the High Court overruled the

objection stating that, all necessary parties had been noticed by the

4thdefendant-appellant in compliance with Section 755 and fixed the case for

argument.

This court held as follows.

The issue at hand falls within the purview of a mistake, omission or defect

on the part of the appellant in complying with the provisions of Section 755.

In such a situation if the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the

respondent has not been materially prejudiced, it was empowered to grant

relief to the appellant on such terms as it deemed just.

In the present case, I have held that the aforementioned failure was not a mistake

or an omission or a defect. Therefore the decision in Jayasekara Vs Lakmini and

Others (supra) has no application to the facts of this case.

In considering the appeal of the Plaintiff-Appellant it is important to consider

Section 770 of the Civil Procedure Code which reads as follows.

8

If, at the hearing of the appeal, the respondent is not present and the court

is not satisfied upon the material in the record or upon other evidence that

the notice of appeal was duly served upon him or his registered attorney as

hereinbefore provided, or if it appears to the court at such hearing that any

person who was a party to the action in the court against whose decree the

appeal is made, but who has not been made a party to the appeal, is

interested in the result of the appeal, the court may issue the requisite notice

of appeal for service.

In terms of the above section the Court of Appeal has the discretion to use the

power granted by the said section. When the failure on the part of the Plaintiff-

Appellant is a deliberate act, the court has the power to refuse to take steps in terms

of Section 770 of the Civil Procedure Code. This view is supported by the

observation made by Ennis J in Ibrahim Vs Beebee 19 NLR 289. Ennis J

discussing the provisions of Section 770 of the Civil Procedure Code made the

following observation.

In my opinion three courses are open to the Court. It may (1) proceed to

hear the appeal as it stands, or (2) add, and give notice to, parties under

the provisions of section 770 of the Civil Procedure Code, or (3) dismiss the

appeal for defect of parties.

For the aforementioned reasons, I reject the contention of learned counsel for the

Plaintiff-Appellant. In view of the conclusion reached above, I answer the 1st

question of law as follows.

If the Civil Appellate High Court allowed the appeal of the Plaintiff-Appellant, it

would have affected the rights of the 3rd Defendant-Respondent.

9

I answer the 2nd to 5th questions of law in the negative. When I consider the

judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court, I feel that there are no reasons to

interfere with the said judgment. For the above reasons, I affirm the judgment of

Civil Appellate High Court and dismiss the appeal of the Plaintiff-Appellant with

costs.

Appeal dismissed.
