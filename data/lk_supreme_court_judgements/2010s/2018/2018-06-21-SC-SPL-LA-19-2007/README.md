Respondents

Before : Sisira J de Abrew J Nalin Perera J Prasanna Jayawardena PC J Counsel : A.S.M. Perera President‟s Counsel with P. Kumarawadu for the Petitioner Ronalad Perera President‟s Counsel for the 1st and the 2nd Respondents S. Herath SSC for the 3rd to 6th Respondents Argued on : 16.1.2018 Decided on : 21.6.2018 Sisira J De Abrew J. The petitioner in his petition has stated the following facts. On

15.1.2007, the petitioner was summoned to Wattegama Police Station on a

complaint made by his niece regarding an allegation that had he obtained

jewellery and a loan of Rs.100,000/- from the said complainant. The

petitioner with his Attorney-at-Law Saman Ratnayake and one Jayawardena

who is one of his friends went to the Police Station. At the Police Station

Saman Ratnayake Attorney-at-Law explained to the 1st Respondent who

conducted the inquiry that the complaint of the complainant was regarding a

civil dispute and left the Police Station. Thereafter when the petitioner tried

to sit on a chair to make a statement the1st Respondent shouted at him

saying „who asked you to sit‟ and started slapping the petitioner. At this

stage the 2nd Respondent too slapped the petitioner. Thereafter the

petitioner‟s hands were tied together at his back with a rope by the 1st and

the 2nd Respondents and they started slapping the petitioner again. When the

petitioner requested the two Police Officers (the 1st and the 2nd Respondents)

3

not to assault him as he is a heart patient they did not listen and threaten to

kill him. Thereafter he was hand cuffed and put to a police jeep. Thereafter

Saman Ratnayake Attorney-at-Law and Abeyratne Attorney-at-Law came to

the Police Station and spoke to the 1st Respondent. On the same day the

petitioner was taken to the Wattegama hospital and later to Yakgahapitiya

hospital as the doctor attached to Wattegama hospital was not available. The

petitioner told the doctor at the Yakgahapitiya hospital that he was suffering

from a pain due to the police assault. On the same day (15.1.2007), the

Police produced the petitioner before the Magistrate Teldeniya on an

allegation of obstructing duties of Police Officers. The learned Magistrate

remanded the petitioner and further ordered that the petitioner be given

medical treatments through Prison Hospital. On 17.1.2007 the learned

Magistrate enlarged the Petitioner on bail. On 18.1.2017 the petitioner got

himself admitted to Kandy General Hospital.

On 19.2.2007, when the petitioner was taking his daughter to the

school, the 2nd Respondent who came on a motor cycle tried to knock him

down. Thereafter on the same day when the petitioner was passing the

Police Station, the 1st Respondent threateningly raised his finger at him.

Thereafter the 1st Respondent filed another B Report against the petitioner in

the Magistrate‟s Court alleging that the petitioner on 20.2.2007 tried to

knock down the 1st Respondent by his vehicle.

The above facts are narrated in the amended petition filed by the

petitioner in this court. Learned President‟s Counsel for the petitioner at the

hearing before us submitted that he does not claim relief in respect of the

incident alleged to have taken place on 19.2.2007. In order to support the

incident alleged to have taken place on 15.1.2007 at the police station, the

petitioner has annexed an affidavit from Maldeniya Gedera Jayawardena

4

who went with him to the Police Station on the said date. Maldeniya Gedera

Jayawardena in his affidavit states that the 1st Respondent assaulted the

petitioner when he tried to sit on a chair saying „who asked you to sit‟; that

the 2nd Respondent too assaulted the petitioner; that on a request made by

the petitioner, he informed Saman Ratnatake Attorney-at-Law; and that later

Saman Ratnatake Attorney-at-Law and Abeyratne Attorney-at-Law came

and spoke to the 1st Respondent. Saman Ratnatake Attorney-at-Law in his

affidavit marked P3 states that on 15.1.2007 he with the petitioner came to

the Police Station and after explaining to the 1st Respondent that matter

complained of was a civil dispute he left the Police Station. Later on hearing

that the petitioner had been assaulted by the police, he came to Wattegama

Police Station and saw the petitioner crying inside a police jeep. He further

states in his affidavit that the petitioner was handcuffed and that he learnt

from the petitioner that the petitioner was assaulted by the 1st and the 2nd

Respondents.

The 1st Respondent in his affidavit filed in this court has taken up

the position that after Saman Ratnatake Attorney-at-Law left the Police

Station, the petitioner started shouting at him and as a result he could not

perform his duty; and that therefore he produced the petitioner before the

learned Magistrate.

The petitioner complains that his fundamental rights guaranteed by

Articles 11,12(1),13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution have been violated by

the Respondents. This court by its order dated 1.11.2007 granted leave to

proceed for alleged violations of Articles 11 and 12(1) of the Constitution.

This court has made an order directing the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO)

to submit Medico Legal Report (MLR) relating to the petitioner. The JMO

has produced the MLR. According to the MLR there were abrasions on both

5

wrist joints of the petitioner It has to be noted here that the JMO Kandy

examined the petitioner on 19.1.2007. The petitioner after being enlarged on

bail got himself admitted to General Hospital, Kandy. When the doctor at

Yakgahapitiya hospital examined the petitioner at 1.45 p.m. on 15.1.2007,

he did not observe the above injuries of the petitioner. The said doctor has

certified in the Medico Legal Examination Form (MLE Form) that the

petitioner did not have any injuries (vide document marked 4R3). The

incident described by the petitioner took place on 15.1.2007. Therefore, the

question that arises is whether the injuries observed by the JMO were

caused while in police custody or after the petitioner was released on bail.

When I consider the above matters, I feel that it is difficult to conclude with

certainty that the said injuries were caused while he was in the custody of

police.

Although the petitioner in his amended petition takes up the position

that he complained to the doctor at Yakgahapitiya hospital that he was

suffering from a pain due to the assault or torture by the Police Officers, the

said doctor in the MLE Form does not support the said version of the

petitioner.

The version of the petitioner that he was kept in a police jeep after

being handcuffed has been corroborated by the affidavits of two lawyers.

Thus, allegation appears to be true. But the Police had reasons to use

minimum force to control him as he was obstructing police duties. Although

Saman Ratnatake Attorney-at-Law in his affidavit marked P3 states that he

told the learned Magistrate that the petitioner had been assaulted by the

police, according to the proceedings of the Magistrate‟s Court dated

15.1.2007 no such submission had been made by Saman Ratnatake

Attorney-at-Law who represented the petitioner before the learned

6

Magistrate. The learned Magistrate had made an order to the effect that the

petitioner should be given medical treatments through Prison Hospital. The

learned Senior State Counsel pointed out that this order may have been

made as the 1st Respondent in his B Report had stated that he used minimum

force towards the petitioner when he obstructed the police duties. Further

the 1st Respondent had moved in the said B Report that the petitioner be

produced in the Mental Hospital and to obtain a report through Prison

Hospital. In my view there is merit in the above contention of learned

Senior State Counsel.

When I consider all the above matters, I am unable to place reliance

on the story of the petitioner. If court can‟t place reliance on the story

narrated by the petitioner it cannot declare that the petitioner fundamental

rights guaranteed by the the Constitution have been violated. This view is

supported by the the judgment of this court in the case of Channa Peiris Vs

Attorney General [1994] 1 SLR 1 wherin this court held as follows.

“In regard to violations of Article 11 (by torture, cruel, inhuman or

degrading treatment or punishment), three general observations apply:

(i) The acts or conduct complained of must be qualitatively of a kind that a

Court may take cognizance of. Where it is not so, the Court will not

declare that Article 11 has been violated.

(ii) Torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment may

take many forms, psychological and physical.

(iii) Having regard to the nature and gravity of the issue, a high degree

of certainty is required before the balance of probability might be said

to tilt in favour of a petitioner endeavouring to discharge his burden of

proving that he was subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or

degrading treatment.”

7

For the above reasons, I hold that there is no merit in story

narrated by the petitioner in his amended petition. I therefore dismiss the

amended petition of the petitioner. Considering the facts of this case I do not

make an order for costs.
