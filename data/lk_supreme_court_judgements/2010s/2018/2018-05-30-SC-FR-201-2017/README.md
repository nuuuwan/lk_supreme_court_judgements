Aluwihare PC, J.

The 1st Petitioner to the application was 5 years and 9 months old at the time of

this application. The 2nd Petitioner is the father of the 1st Petitioner and is

prosecuting this application as the next friend of the 1st Petitioner. In the present

application, they claim that the 1st to the 7th Respondents have violated their right

to equality and equal protection of law guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution by denying school admission to the 1st Petitioner to Grade 1 in year

2017.

A brief account of the facts is as follows.

The 2nd Petitioner states that Southlands Balika Vidyalaya (hereinafter the

school) published a Gazette Notification in June 2016 calling applications for

the admission of students for Grade1. The 2nd Petitioner dispatched a duly

completed application along with the supporting documents on or about 9th June

2016.

3

The instrument which regulates the procedure for School admission is the

Education Ministry Circular No. 17/2016 (Admission of Students to Year I for

the year 2017). According to Clause 6.1 of the Circular, an applicant can submit

an application for school admission under one or more of the following

categories:

(i) Children of Residents in close proximity to the School

(ii) Children of Parents who are past pupils

(iii) Brother/Sister of student already in the School

(iv) Children of officials employed in the Education Service

(v) Children of officers employed in the Government sector and transferred

on exigencies of work

(vi) Children of persons presently in Sri Lanka after residing abroad with

children

Although the 2nd Petitioners wife is a past pupil of the Southlands Balika

Vidyalaya, the 2nd Petitioner states that they only applied under the proximity to

the school category as they were confident of obtaining admission under that

category. As a response to this application, the petitioners were asked to present

themselves for an interview on 18. 08. 2016.

At the interview, the panel examined the documents to verify whether the

Petitioner fulfils the requirements under the said category. As per Clause 6.1 (III)

of the Circular, an applicant who applies under the proximity to the school

category loses 5 marks per school where there are schools, other than the one

applied for admission, in the vicinity. The number of schools are determined by

drawing a circle taking the distance between the residence and school as the

radius. The map pertaining to the Petitioners is marked and produced as P4.

Accordingly, the Petitioners state that they were awarded 90 marks at the

interviewthe missing 10 points being deductions made in view of two

intervenient schools namely, Sangamiththa Vidyalaya and Covenant Balika

4

Vidyalaya within the said radius. The Petitioner has marked his copy of the marks

sheet given by the interview panel marked P 6 which shows the breakdown of

the 90 marks;

a) The Applicant (2nd Petitioner) and the spouse have

been registered in the Electoral Register for the

past 5 years from the year prior to the application.

35 marks

b) Documents in proof of residency (Title deed) 10 marks

c) Additional documents in proof of Residency (NIC,

Electricity and water bills, life insurance etc) 5 marks

d) Proximity to the school from the place of

residence 40 marks

As per clause 8.3(b) of the Circular, once the interviews are concluded the

relevant school must display a provisional list and a waiting list where the

applicants who obtained the highest marks are listed in chronological order.

Clause 8.3 (g) provides that objections and appeals to and against the interim list

should be preferred within two weeks from the date of display. The School must

constitute an Appeal and Objection Inquiry Board and refer all the appeals and

objections to the said Board. In particular, where an objection is tendered the

Board must interview the parties separately and verify the veracity of the

objection. At the end of this process, as per clause 10. 9, the Board must enter the

new marks (if there are additions/reductions) both in a separate registry

maintained by them and in the objections/appeals column in the applicants

copy of the marks sheet.

The Provisional List of the Southlands Balika Vidyalaya was displayed on the

Schools Notice Board on 17. 12. 2016 and the 1st Petitioners was ranked 12th in

the said list. However, they were subsequently informed that an objection has

been tendered against the 1st Petitioners admission to the school. Accordingly,

5

they were required to present themselves for an inquiry before the Schools

Appeals and Objections Inquiry Board. The 2nd Petitioner states that at the said

inquiry he was informed that no reduction of marks would take place. However,

when the Final List of students admitted to the School appeared on the School

Notice Board on 14. 01. 2017 the Petitioners observed that the 1st Petitioners

name was not listed.

The 2nd Petitioner states that he attempted to prefer an appeal but that the 1st

Respondent declined to accept it. He further claims that the list bore the names of

several others who had obtained lower marks than him at the interview.

Thereafter, the 2nd Petitioner complained to the Human Rights Commission,

Matara on 08. 02. 2017 alleging that the 1st Respondent violated his right to

equality. An inquiry was conducted by the HRC on 09. 05. 2017 and the 2nd

Petitioner was informed on 31. 05. 2017 that there was no violation of his

fundamental rights.

The Petitioners thereafter invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 126

of the Constitution, pleading inter alia;

To declare that the failure to admit the 1st Petitioner to Grade one for the

year 2017 at Southlands Balika Vidyalaya, Galle by the 1st Respondent is an

infringement or continuing infringement of the Petitioners fundamental

rights guaranteed to them under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution by the

1st to the 7th Respondents or any one or more of them;

To declare that the 1st Petitioner is entitled to be admitted to Grade 1 for

2017 at Southlands Balika Vidyalaya Galle;

To direct the 1st to the 7th Respondents or anyone or more of them to admit

the 1st Petitioner to Grade 1 for 2017 at Southland Balika Vidyalaya Galle;

In their observations, the Respondents claim that the Court cannot grant the

reliefs claimed by the Petitioners as it contravenes Circular No.17/2016. They

6

point out that although the Petitioners received 90 marks at the interview,

pursuant to a site visit carried out by the Appeals and Objections Inquiry Board, it

was revealed that there were not 2 but in fact 6 intervening schools within the

radius. On account of this discovery, 5 marks per school were deductedwhich

in the end left the 1st Petitioner with only 75 marks. The 1st Respondent submitted

that the cut off mark for that year under the proximity to the school category

was set at 76 and as such, the 1st Petitioner was ineligible for admission. The 1st

Respondent further states that a letter informing reasons for non-selection was

sent by normal post to the Petitioners. They have produced a list marked R2

containing the names of all persons to whom such letters had been sent.

With that, I turn to consider the legal question presented in the present

application. The gravamen of the Petitioner is that the 1st to the 7th Respondents

failure to admit the 1st Petitioner to Grade one for the year 2017 at Southlands

Balika Vidyalaya is arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, discriminatory and

amounts to an infringement of the Petitioners right to equality and equal

protection of law under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

For the complaint of an unequal treatment of law to succeed the petitioner must

show that the unequal treatment was meted out in the performance of a lawful

act. It is a cardinal principle that equal treatment should be referable to the

exercise of a valid right, founded in law in contradistinction to an illegal right

which is illegal in law.

In fact, the decision in C. W. Mackie and Co. Ltd. v Commissioner-General of

Inland Revenue and others (1986) 1 SLR 300 had considered this legal point

where it was held that Article 12 of the Constitution guarantees equal protection

of the law and not equal violation of the law. In that case, Sharvananda, C.J., was

of the view that,

"[] the equal treatment guaranteed by Article 12, is equal treatment in the

performance of a lawful act. Via Article 12, one cannot seek the execution of an

7

illegal act. Fundamental to this postulate of equal treatment is that it should be

referable to the exercise of a valid right, founded in law in contradistinction to an

illegal right which is valid in law."

In Gamaethige v Siriwardene (1988) 1 SLR 384 the petitioner was the General

Secretary of the Sri Lanka Government Clerical Union and was released for full

time Trade Union work. In view of petitioner's participation in a strike from

17.07.1980 to 12.08.1980, he was treated as having vacated his employment,

but later on appeal he was reinstated. Earlier in 1973 the petitioner's name had

been registered in the waiting list for Government Quarters. In June 1984 prior

to the petitioner's reinstatement in service, the petitioner's eligibility for quarters

was re-examined, and upon it being reported that he was not in service, his

name was deleted from the waiting list for Government Quarters. He alleged

discrimination stating that preferential treatment was accorded to the respondent

and four others who were not in the waiting list and another employed on

contract after retirement who had been given Government Quarters though their

names were not in the waiting list. Justice Mark Fernando, refusing the

application observed that;

"Here the petitioner's allegation that these persons were not in the waiting list

and/or were not eligible for General Service Quarters amounts to an allegation

that quarters were allocated in breach of the relevant rules. Two wrongs do not

make a right, and on proof of the commission of one wrong the equal protection

of the law cannot be invoked to obtain relief in the form of an order compelling

commission of a second wrong."

In T. V. Setty v. Commissioner, Corporation of the City of Bangalore (1968)

Mysore 251 the petitioner complained that the Bangalore City Municipal

Corporation violated Article 14 of the Indian Constitution, which corresponds to

Article 12 of our Constitution, by refusing him a licence to carry on manufacture

of soaps in the premises in which he has been so doing, while permitting a

8

number of other soap manufacturers to carry on the same in similar

circumstances. Dealing with this submission Chandrashekhar J. expressed that:

"Assuming that the Corporation has issued to those persons licences improperly

and against the provisions of the Corporation Act and by laws thereunder, Article

14 of the Constitution cannot be understood as requiring the authorities to act

illegally in one case because they have acted illegally in other cases".

This principle was followed by G.P.S De Silva J. (as he then was) in Jayasekera v

Wipulasekera (1988) 2 SLR 237 and by Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake J. (as she

then was) in Seelawansa Thero And Two Others v Tennakoon, Additional

Secretary, Public Service Commission (2004) 2 SLR 241.

In the present case, as per the map marked P4 it is clear that there are in fact 6

other schools within the perimeter. Although it is surprising as to how the said 6

intervening schools escaped the attention of the 1st Respondent during the first

interview and resulted in the award of 90 marks, the Respondents have not

committed an illegality by subsequently reducing the marks from 90 to 75. The

2nd Petitioner alleges that the Respondents have not reduced the marks of other

applicants despite there been a similar number of schools intervening in their

respective cases. While this speaks of an unfortunate turn of events, in so far as

the Court is concerned, the conduct of the Respondents in admitting other

applicants who have presumably received lower marks than the Petitioners

cannot give rise to a legitimate expectation. The petitioners cannot request this

Court to compel the Respondents to act illegally in this case for the mere reason

that they have acted illegally in previous cases. The relief which the Petitioner

claims is a relief which this Court as a Court of law and Equity cannot provide

since "Illegality and equity are not on speaking terms".

Before concluding, I wish to address certain other grievances which the

Petitioners have complained of in the application. The Petitioner strenuously

argued that, contrary to what the 1st and the 2nd Respondents claim in paragraph

9

14 in their respective objections, no site visit was carried out by members of the

Appeals and Objections Inquiry Board on or about 30. 12. 2016. It is also

observed that save and except for the aforesaid paragraphs in the objections, no

other documentary proof substantiating the Respondents position is before this

Court. This is despite clause 8.3(c) of the Circular requiring them to maintain a

separate comprehensive record of all the site visits, inclusive of the names of

persons who conducted the visit, the date and their signatures. However, the 1st

Respondent has brought to the attention of this Court that the officials of the

Bribery Commission have taken custody of files relevant for school admission for

the year 2017. In those circumstances, the Court is precluded from ascertaining

the veracity of the respective claims. In any event, a finding in this regard would

not make the Court come to a different conclusion.

In addition, the Petitioners also assert that a verbal assurance was given by the

members of the Objections and Appeals Inquiry Board that no marks will be

deducted. The Petitioners have adduced P6 which proves this position. In terms

of clause 10. 9 of the Circular, the members of the Appeals and Objections

Inquiry Board must note the amended marks in red ink, in the Appeals and

Objections Column in the applicants copy of the mark sheet. However, there are

no such marking on P6, which lends credence to the Petitioners position.

Nevertheless, the failure to mark the amended marks by itself does not preclude

the Respondents from subsequently altering their position. In terms of clause

10.10 of the Circular, the Respondents are empowered to take steps which are

necessary to ascertain the facts relevant for an application. This includes making

site inspection. Furthermore, as per clause 8.2 (a) the Respondents are also

authorized to subsequently deduct marks where any irregularity is detected. In

terms of clause 8.2 (a) this risk was made known to the 2nd Petitioner when he

signed and obtained the mark sheet P6 at the very first interview. Thus, while

in the ordinary course it is prudent that the amended marks be duly noted and

10

communicated to the applicants at the desired point, one must also be mindful

that late discoveries that vitiate the eligibility of the applicant makes an exception

to this practice.

In the result, I hold that the petitioners have not been successful in establishing

that their fundamental right guaranteed in terms of Article 12(1) was violated by

the respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed.

In the circumstances of the case I make no order as to costs.
