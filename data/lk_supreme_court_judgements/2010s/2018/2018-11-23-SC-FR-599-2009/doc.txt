Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

Petitioner to the present application Galapita Hene Gedara Nandani Kumari had come before

this court alleging the violation of her Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Articles 11, 12 (1)

and 13 (2) of the Constitution by the Respondents. When this matter was supported on

18.11.2009, the court granted leave to proceed,

a) For the alleged violation of Article 11 of the Constitution against 2nd ,4th,6th,7th,8th and 9th

Respondents and,

b) For the alleged violation of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution against 2nd and 4th to the 11th

Respondents.

The Petitioner who is a housewife, was married to one S.M. Abeyrathne a graduate teacher, and

was 45 years of age and a mother of 3 children, at the time the alleged incident referred to in

the petition was taken place.

4 According to the Petitioner, an incident had taken place near her house on 27th June 2008

around 2.00 pm with one Padma Kumari Ekanayake when she was trying to dispose the garbage

which was collected near her house, which ended up by the said Padma Kumari assaulting the

Petitioner with a club. The son and the brother of the Petitioner rescued her from the said

assault but her son had received a blow at that time. The Petitioner admits giving few blows to

the said Padma Kumari with the Eacle broom she had in her hand to escape from the assault but

denies that she had a knife with her at that time. On the same day around 3.30 pm two women

Police Constables accompanied by two male Police Constables came to her house in a private

vehicle and arrested her and taken to the Raththota Police Station in the same vehicle.

The Petitioner narrates the events that took place thereafter as follows;

a) At the Police Station the Petitioner got to know that there was a complaint lodged by the

said Padma Kumari of cutting her with a knife by the Petitioner which she denied to the

Police.

b) The Petitioner informed Police of the assault by the said Padma Kumari but the Police

refused to entertain her complaint

c) The said Padma Kumari had got herself admitted to Raththota Hospital

d) A statement was recorded from the Petitioner by an officer, but the said statement was

never read over to her by the said officer. She was forced to sign the statement saying

“;uqfia ljqo lshj,d n,kak' ;uqfif.a lg jeähs' ug f.or hkak mrlal=

fjkjd fukak fïlg w;aika lrkjd'”

e) The Petitioner was kept at the Police station the whole night and was sent to courts

around 12.00 noon by the 3rd Respondent through 4th Respondent PS 12862 Wasantha.

5

f) When the Petitioner was produced before court, the 4th Respondent objected for bail

informing that the complainant is critically injured and hospitalized. Court remanded the

Petitioner for fiscal custody until 30.11.2008

g) With the said remand order the Petitioner was taken to the Matale Remand Prison

where the 2nd Respondent, the husband of the said Padma Kumari functioned as the

Officer-in-Charge by the 4th Respondent

h) When she was produced at the Remand Prison, the Petitioner saw the 4th Respondent

greeting the 2nd Respondent by holding his hand and saying, “Tkak upx wfma jefâ

yrs”

i) The same evening around 5.30 pm the Petitioner was taken to Kandy Remand Prison. At

that time the Petitioner heard the female officer accompanied her to Kandy, saying,

“fïl ud;f,a nkaOkd.drfha ´' whs' iS f. tlla”

j) Following morning, the Petitioner was taken to a room by several female prison guards

including the 7th and 9th Respondents and assaulted her for some time. Even though the

Petitioner pleaded with them not to assault, they continued to assault her until the 6th

and the 8th Respondents wanted her to be taken to their room

k) While the Petitioner being taken to the new room, she was pushed by an officer from her

behind. When she fell into the room, she was kicked by the officers, she was assaulted

inside room by 6th to 9th Respondents and during the said assault, she was slapped

several times on her ears, knocked her head on the wall several times. During the said

assault, she heard either the 6th or the 8th Respondent saying, “f;daj ndf.g urkak

lsh,hs ´' whs' iS uy;a;h wmsg lsõfj”

6

l) Since the Petitioner started vomiting after the said assault, she was taken before a

medical officer but, due to the presence of the 6th Respondent the Petitioner refrained

from complaining against those who assaulted her little while ago.

m) Before taking her to Matale on the following day morning, at Kandy she was threatened

not to divulge the assault to anybody, saying that she will be subject to assault once

again if she returned

n) At Matale Remand the 2nd Respondent threatened her with death if she continues to

make trouble and warned her not to talk to anybody as to what happened to her at the

Remand

o) Even though the Petitioner requested her Attorney-at-Law to inform court with regard to

the brutal assault on her at the Remand Prison, the Attorney-at-Law did not inform court

of the assault, but only moved bail on her. The Petitioner was granted bail on that day

As revealed above the Petitioner had not complained to anybody except to her Attorney-at-Law,

of the assault on her until she was bailed out from courts, but, the Petitioner explain the reason

for not complaining the assault to the prison doctor but had taken up the position that her

Attorney-at-Law did not make use of the opportunity to inform the Magistrate when she was

produced before court. However it is transpired from the material placed before this court that,

the Petitioner got herself admitted to the Matale hospital immediately after her release on the

30th itself.

The Consultant Judicial Medical Officer Matale who examined the Petitioner at the Matale

hospital had recorded the short history given by the patient as follows;

“Alleged assault by four female prison officers at Bogambara Remand Prison on

29.06.2008 after the victim had been remanded. Earlier the examinee was arrested by

7

Raththota Police following a quarrel with neighbor, wife of a prison officer H.M.

Ekanayake.”

During his examination the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer had observed five injuries, out of

which the 5th injury, “high frequency hearing impairment” had been found as a grievous injury

and under explanatory remakes he had remarked, that there is a “Permanent impairment of

hearing on both ears”

In support of the above observation, a copy of the G.H.T including the tests carried out and the

examination notes of the Consultant E.N.T Surgeon were also placed before this court marked

P-3A.

As further observed by me the Petitioner made a detailed statement before the learned

Magistrate Matale on 17.10.2008 when the case against her was called before the Magistrate

for the 1st time after enlarging her on bail. However prior to 17/10, the Petitioner on 08.08.2008

had made a complaint to Women and Children Unit of Kandy Police and to the Human Rights

Commission on 04.07.2008 through her husband.

Whilst challenging the above position taken up by the Petitioner, the Respondents, specially the

2nd and the 6th to the 9th Respondents heavily relied on the subsequent inquiries carried out by

the prison authorities and the affidavit given by the Chief Jailer and the statement made by

Medical Officer attached to the Kandy Remand Prison on the day in question to an official who

conducted an inquiry.

In his affidavit the Chief Jailer had submitted that there was no possibility of assaulting a

prisoner during the day time as complained by the Petitioner, without the knowledge of the

8 others and had further submitted that the Petitioner did not complained of such assault to him

when he visited the new prisoners around 3.30 pm on 29.06.2008 (8R4)

In her statement made at the Prison Inquiry, produced marked 6R2 the Prison Doctor A. Hairu

Nisha had stated that she examined the new admissions between 10.00 -11.00 including the

Petitioner. The Petitioner did not complain of any assault to her and she was found to be in fit

condition. Therefore she entered fit in front of her name in the admissions register but when the

prisoner informed that she is taking treatment for some condition in both her hands form Kandy

Hospital, the doctor had cut the previous entry by drawing a line and recorded that the prisoner

is taking “treatment for numbness of both hands GHK”

As observed by me earlier, the Petitioner had explained the reasons for not making a complaint

to the Prison Doctor, specially in the presence of the 6th Respondent, and she had to continue to

be in remand prison until the following morning. One cannot expect a person who has neither

been to a prison before nor had a criminal record to come out with a complainant against the

lady Prison Officers under whose custody she had to be until the following morning. This

position is explained by the Petitioner in the following terms in her counter affidavit;

“I being a new remandee was retained within the premises while the others were taken

for an event. I was produced before the Medical Officer by the 6th Respondent who

gestured threatening me not to reveal the assault. I did not reveal the assault accordingly

as I feared reprisals and instead cried before the doctor due to the mental and physical

pain I was suffering”

I have no reason to reject the above position taken by the Petitioner. The reserve officer at

Raththota Police Station had not made any adverse comments with regard to the conditions of

9 the Petitioner when she was produced at the reserve at 16.40 hours by PS 6502 Premachandra

who recorded the statement of the Petitioner. The Petitioner makes no complaint of assault

against the officers at Raththota Police Station. The Petitioner who was remanded for Fiscal

Custody on 28.06.2008 was enlarged on bail on 30.06.2008 and on 30th itself she got herself

admitted to Matale Hospital, and was in hospital until 8th July, until she was discharged. As

referred to above the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer had observed 5 injuries including one

grievous injury, permanent impairment of hearing of both ears.

When referring to the assault, the Petitioner had taken up the position that she was pushed

inside the room of the 6th and 8th Respondents by some body from behind and when she fell

inside the room, she was first kicked and thereafter pulled her up and assaulted by the 6th to 9th

Respondents where she was slapped on her ears several times and knocked her head against the

wall.

In the absence of any other material to establish that the Petitioner had received the injuries

referred to in the Medico Legal Report including the 5th injury, at a different place, either prior to

being arrested or after the release from the custody, I have no reason to disbelieve the

Petitioner as to how she received those injuries. In this regard I am further mindful of the fact

that the Petitioner is a house wife with three children and was taken into custody for an

altercation between two village women over disposing some garbage. She is neither being in the

prison custody previously, nor charged before a Court of Law on criminal charges.

The next issue to be considered by this court is whether there was any undue influence on the

officers of Raththota Police Station in conducting investigations in the present case.

10 As revealed before this court, the first complaint into this incident had been made by one Padma

Kumari to Raththota Police Station on 27.06.2008 at 15.00 hours (R-1) but a police party consist

of PS 6502 Premachandra, PS 28766 Jayakody, WPC 6011 Kumari and WPC 4623 Shalika had left

the Police Station in order to arrest the petitioner on the instructions of the Office–in-Charge at

14.30 hours (R-2 out entry) in a private van, i.e. 30 minutes prior to the first complaint being

recorded. The Petitioner was arrested by the said team at her place at 15.10 hours six kilometers

away from the Police Station for the alleged offence of assault to the complainant Kumari (R-2

return entry)

According to the first complaint, (R-1) the complainant had taken up the position that she

received a cut injury in one of her finger due to the attack by the Petitioner with a knife.

The complainant, who was issued with a MLE form, had got herself admitted to the Raththota

Hospital on the same day. The said MLE form is produced marked R-9 and it confirm that the

complainant had a non-grievous cut injury inflicted by a sharp weapon, but under the remarks

column the Medical Officer District Hospital Raththota had observed that “Possibility of self-

inflicted cannot be excluded”

When the Petitioner was produced before the Magistrate’s Court, the Police had requested the

learned Magistrate to remand the suspect for 14 days. An application was made on behalf of the

suspect (Petitioner) for bail by an Attorney-at-Law. In the journal entry the learned Magistrate

had recorded the day’s proceedings as follows;

“ielldrsh î jd¾:djla iu.ska P.S 12862 jika; úiska b$lrhs' ie' k's î'

.=Kfialr ñh fmkS isáñka wem wheo isà'

When considering matters already referred to above, it is observed that this is a complaint

received by police over an altercation between two women in a village over disposing garbage in

a compound but, for some reason the police had taken an undue interest in arresting the

suspect in the manner as discussed. The police team had left the station in a private vehicle,

even prior to a first complaint being recorded. The complainant was hospitalized over a non-

grievous injury inflicted on a finger but the medical officer who examined the patient, had not

ruled out the possibility of self-inflicted injury. At the Magistrate’s Court, bail was objected to for

the reason that;

a) Injury inflicted by a knife

b) Complainant is receiving treatment at the hospital.

Even though the police, when reporting facts before the Magistrate had taken up the position

that the suspect (Petitioner) had used a knife to inflict the injury, no investigation was carried

out to recover the knife used by the suspect at the time of her arrest or during subsequent

investigation. (R-2)

When the above facts are taken into consideration with the position taken up by the Petitioner

that she heard the 4th Respondent who took her to the Remand Prison informing the 2nd

Respondent that “Tkak upx wfma jefâ yrs” is a clear indications that the investigations

12 said to have conducts by Raththota Police, was not carried impartially but it was carried with the

intention of remanding the Petitioner due to some influence on them.

During the argument before this court, the learned counsel who represented the Respondents

had challenged the position taken up by the Petitioner with regard to certain statements said to

have made by some of the Respondents and argued that it is unsafe to act purely on the

affidavit of the Petitioner and come to a conclusion that those Respondents have made such

statements in the presence of the Petitioner, in the absence of any corroboration.

I do agree with the submission of the counsel that there is no corroboration by way of another

affidavit before this court, but I cannot agree with the rest of the argument since the position

taken up by the Petitioner is corroborated from independent material placed before this court.

The statements said to have made by the 2nd, 4th and 6th to the 9th Respondents reveal the

interest taken by the 2nd and 6th to the 9th Respondents in this matter. The 4th Respondent was

not involved in the initial investigation and therefore it is not safe to make him liable for the

interest the police had taken in conducting the investigation as referred to in this judgment.

During the argument it was brought to the notice of court, the death of 5th Respondent whilst

pending the present application.

When considering the matters referred to above in this judgment, I observe that the officers of

Raththota Police Station had arrested the Petitioner even prior to a first complaint being

received form Padma Kumari the wife of the 2nd Respondent who was the Officer-in-Charge of

Matale Remand Prison. Bail was objected to by Raththota Police when they filed the ‘B’ Report

before court. The learned Magistrate based on the ‘B’ Report before him, remanded the

Petitioner for Fiscal Custody considering the fact that,

13

a) Injury inflicted by a knife

b) Injured is receiving treatment at Hospital.

However the only injury the Medical Officer found with the complainant was a non-grievous cut

injury on a finger, which cannot be ruled out the possibility of self-inflicted injury.

At Kandy Remand Prison the Petitioner was subjected to physical assault by 4 lady prison guards

whom the Petitioner identified as 6th to 9th Respondents. They kicked her, slapped her on her

ears and her head was knocked against the wall. The Consultant Judicial Medical Officer Matale,

had observed 5 injuries including a grievous injury, “a high frequency hearing impairment,”

which he identified as a permanent disability.

When considering all these matters I observe that the investigations said to have carried out by

the Raththota Police and the subsequent incidents took place both at Matale Remand Prison

and Kandy Remand Prison by the 2nd, 6th to the 9th Respondents are in violation of the

Fundamental Rights guaranteed under article 11 and 12 (1) of the Constitution.

The Petitioner who is a housewife with 3 children was subject to cruel and inhuman treatment in

the hands of the prison officials when she was remanded for causing a simple cut injury on a

finger of the wife of the 2nd Respondent, the Officer-in-Charge of the Remand Prison Matale. As

further revealed before us, the Petitioner was acquitted and discharged from the case filed

against her on the said complaint before the Magistrate’s Court of Matale, but she suffer from a

permanent disability due to the said brutal assault on her during the time she was in Remand

Prison.

The said conduct of the 2nd and 6th to the 9th Respondents can only be explained in the following

word used by Atukorale J in the case of Amal Sudath Silva V. Kodituwakku (1987) 2 Sri LR 119,

14

“Nothing shocks the conscience of a man so much as the cowardly act of a delinquent

police officer who subjects a helpless suspect in his charge to depraved and barbarous

method of treatment within the confines of the very premises in which he is held in

custody…….

The Petitioner may be a hard-core criminal whose tribe deserves no sympathy, but if

constitutional guarantees are to have any meaning or value in our democratic set-up, it is

essential that he be not denied the protection- guaranteed by our constitution.”

In the said circumstances, I hold that the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 11 had

been violated by the 2nd and 6th to the 9th Respondents and Article 12 (1) had been violated by

the 2nd, 6th to 11th Respondents.

In determining the relief to be granted to the Petitioner I am mindful of the following

observations made by Kulatunge J in the case of Gamlath V. Nevil Silva and others (1991) 2 Sri

LR 267 at 278 to the effect that;

“….. violations of Article 11 of the Constitution which symbolizes man’s inhumanity to

man continue. Such infractions make the state primarily liable. In awarding just and

equitable relief we are mindful of the fact that the state has to pay compensation out of

public funds; but this court cannot on that ground resile from making an appropriate

order. The state has to pay in view of the principle of state responsibility for executive

and administrative action. If payment of compensation in default is a burden on public

funds, it cannot be helped. In any event compensation ordered is payable to the citizen

whose rights are violated and Constitutes a just levy on public funds in favour of the

citizen….”

15 When considering all the matters referred to above in this judgment I grant the Petitioner,

a) A declaration that her Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 11 of the

Constitution have been infringed by the 2nd , 6th to the 9th Respondents

b) A declaration that her Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution have been infringed by the 2nd, 6th to the 11th Respondents

c) Compensation in a sum of Rupees five hundred thousand (500,000/-) together with cost

in a sum of Rupees fifty thousand (50,000/-) payable by the state

d) Compensation in a sum of Rupees two hundred thousand (200,000/-) payable by the 2nd

Respondent from his personal funds

e) Compensation in a sum of Rupees seventy five thousand (75,000/-) by each of the 6th to

9th Respondents [Total Compensation payable by the 6th to the 9th Respondents is Rupees

three hundred thousand (300,000/-)] from their personal funds

I further direct the 12th Respondent, Attorney General to consider prosecuting the

Respondents who are liable to be prosecuted under the provisions of the Torture Act if no

steps had been taken so far to prosecute them before the relevant Magistrate’s Court.

Application allowed.
