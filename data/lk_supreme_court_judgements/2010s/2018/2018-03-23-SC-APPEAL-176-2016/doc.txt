Sisira J De Abrew J

Plaintiff Judgment Creditor Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the Plaintiff-Respondent) filed action against the Defendant Judgment

Debtor Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Defendant-Respondent) to get a declaration that the Defendant-Respondent was

holding property in dispute in trust for the Plaintiff-Respondent; that in the event of

the Defendant-Respondent failing to execute a deed in favour of the Plaintiff-

Respondent to direct the Registrar of the court to execute the deed in favour of the

Plaintiff-Respondent; and to eject the Defendant-Respondent and her agents from

the property in dispute. The case was decided ex-parte since the Defendant-

Respondent did not respond to the summons. The ex-parte judgment was delivered

on 13.6.2015. The writ against the defendant-Respondent was executed on

21.6.2006. The fiscal broke open the house (the property in dispute) which had been

padlocked and handed over the possession of the property to the Plaintiff-

Respondent. Thereafter on 4.7.2006 the Petitioner-Petitioner-Petitioner-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner-Appellant) filed a petition under Section

328 of the Civil Procedure Code (hereinafter referred to as the CPC) to restore him

in possession. The learned District Judge by order dated 23.9.2013 refused the

application of the Petitioner-Appellant. Being aggrieved by the said order of the

learned District Judge the Petitioner-Appellant filed an appeal in the Civil Appellate

High Court. The Civil Appellate High Court by its judgment dated 7.12.2015

dismissed the appeal. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the Civil Appellate

High Court, the Petitioner-Appellant has filed this appeal in this court. This court by

its order dated 29.9.2016 granted leave to appeal on question of law set out in

paragraph 24(iii) of the petition of appeal dated 14.1.2016 which is stated below.

Have the Honourable Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court not considered the

possession of the Petitioner-Appellant in the form of constructive trust?

Facts of this case may be briefly summarized as follows:

The Defendant-Respondent by Deed No.186 attested by Gallage Indika

Jayanth Perera Notary Public marked P9 sold the property in dispute to Wilfred

Rohan Senaratne on 6.5.2004. Wilfred Rohan Senaratne by Deed No.228 attested by

RD Attanayake marked P5 sold the property in dispute to Suresh Danial and

Chandrika Bernard on 30.6.2004. Suresh Danial and Chandrika Bernard on the same

day (30.6.2004) mortgaged it to a Finance Company. After redeeming the mortgage,

said Suresh Danial and Chandrika Bernard by Deed No.235 attested by ND

Hirimuthugala marked P1 sold the property in dispute to the Petitioner-Appellant on

20.3.2006. The Plaint was filed in the District Court on 6.7.2004 against the

Defendant-Respondent Princy Mala Abeysooriya. Therefore it is seen that when the

plaint was filed, the Defendant-Respondent (Princy Mala Abeysooriya) was not the

owner of the property. As I pointed out earlier, the Defendant-Respondent Princy

Mala Abeysooriya on 6.5.2004 had sold the property in dispute to Wilfred Rohan

Senaratne. The writ issued by the District Court was executed on 21.6.2006. When

the writ was executed the owner of the property was the Petitioner-Appellant by

virtue of Deed No.235 dated 20.3.2006. The learned District Judge dismissed the

application of the Petitioner-Appellant filed under Section 328 of the CPC. The

most important question that must be decided in this case is whether the above

conclusion reached by the learned District Judge is correct or not. Section 328 of the

CPC reads as follows.

“Where any person other than judgment-debtor or a person in occupation

under him is dispossessed of any property in execution of a decree, he may,

6

within fifteen days of such dispossession, apply to the Court by petition in

which the judgment-creditor shall be named respondent complaining of such

dispossession. The Court shall thereupon serve a copy of such petition on

such respondent and require such respondent to file objections, if any, within

fifteen days of the service of the petition on him. Upon such objections being

filed or after the expiry of the date on which such objections were directed to

be filed, the Court shall, after notice to all parties concerned, hold an inquiry.

Where the Court is satisfied that the person dispossessed was in possession of

the whole or part of such property on his own account or on account of some

person other than the Judgment debtor, it shall by order direct that the

Petitioner be put into possession of the property or part thereof, as the case

may be. Every inquiry under this section shall be concluded within sixty days

of the date fixed for the filing of objections.”

In order to succeed in an application under Section 328 of the CPC, the person

dispossessed must prove that he was in possession of the property when the writ was

executed. The Petitioner-Appellant who was dispossessed from the property in

dispute filed an application under Section 328 of the CPC. The learned District

Judge dismissed the said application of the Petitioner-Appellant. The basis of the

conclusion of the learned District Judge appears to be that the Petitioner-Appellant

was not occupying the property in dispute at the time of execution of the writ

(21.6.2006). The learned District Judge in his judgment has also observed that the

Petitioner-Appellant was not in possession of the property in dispute. But the

learned District Judge has, on the basis of the evidence of the Petitioner-Appellant,

observed that the Petitioner-Appellant had received the keys of the property in

dispute on 30.4.2006. The writ issued by the District Court was executed on

21.6.2006. This shows that he had obtained possession of the property in dispute

7

before the execution of the writ. It is an undisputed fact that on 21.6.2006 (the day

of the execution of the writ) the Petitioner-Appellant was not in the country as he

had gone abroad. If a person does not occupy a property, does it mean that he does

not possess the property? In my view, occupation and possession are two different

things. One can possess a property without occupying the same. To prove

possession it is not necessary to prove that he or she lives in the property or occupies

the property. In the present case, the Petitioner-Appellant purchased the property on

20.3.2006. The Petitioner-Appellant after purchasing the property, had made an

application to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to convert electricity in his name.

In the said application marked P14, the Grama Niladhari has made an endorsement

on 11.5.2006 to the effect that the Petitioner-Appellant was the present occupier of

the property in question. He has also made an endorsement to the effect that ‘not in

occupation’. The Grama Niladhari in her evidence has stated that she certified the

said application marked P14 on the basis that the Petitioner-Appellant is the owner

of the property and that she did so after examining the relevant deed. The CEB has

after examining the said application P14 has converted the electricity in the name of

the Petitioner-Appellant on 11.5.2006. The writ was executed on 21.6.2006 when

keys of the property were with the Petitioner-Appellant. The Petitioner-Appellant in

his evidence has clearly stated that when he purchased the property in dispute he

received the keys from the previous owner; that thereafter repaired the house; that

when the carpenters were repairing the house the doors of the house were opened;

that he possessed the property in dispute on his own title; that he purchased the

property after studying advertisement published in Silumina News Paper; that he

purchased the property as an investment; and that when the Plaint was filed by the

Plaintiff-Respondent, the Defendant-Respondent was not even the owner of the

property. When I consider the above material, it is clear that the Petitioner-Appellant

8

was in possession of the property in dispute when the writ was executed and that he

was dispossessed. The Petitioner-Appellant was not the judgment debtor or is not a

person in occupation under the judgment debtor. When I consider all the

aforementioned matters, I am of the view that the Petitioner-Appellant has no

connection whatsoever with the judgment debtor in this case.

In order to succeed an application under Section 328 of the CPC the

following matters must be established.

1. The person making the application is not the judgment debtor or is not a

person holding the property under the judgment debtor.

2. The person making the application was in possession of the property at the

time of execution of the writ.

3. The person making the application was dispossessed of the property as a

result of the execution of the writ.

When I consider all the aforementioned matters, I hold that the Petitioner-Appellant

has proved that he is not the judgment debtor or not a person occupying the property

in dispute under him; that he was in possession of the property in dispute at the time

of execution of the writ; that he was dispossessed of the property in dispute as a

result of the execution of the writ; and that he was possessing the property at the

time of dispossession on his own title derived from deed No.235 dated 20.3.2006

attested by ND Hirimuthugoda Notary Public. I therefore hold that the Petitioner-

Appellant has satisfied the requirements under Section 328 of the CPC. Considering

the all the aforementioned matters, I hold that the learned District Judge erred when

he refused the application of the Petitioner-Appellant made under Section 328 of the

CPC. The learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court have failed to consider

9

the above matters and have affirmed the order of the learned District Judge. I hold

that the judges of the Civil Appellate High Court too misdirected themselves on

facts and law when they affirmed the order of the learned District Judge. For the

above reasons, I answer the above question of law as follows. ‘The Petitioner-

Appellant was in possession of the land on his own title and was not a judgment

debtor or not a person holding the property under the judgment debtor.’

For the aforementioned reasons, I set aside the order of the learned

District Judge dated 23.9.2013 and the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court

dated 7.12.2015. I hold that the Petitioner-Appellant has succeeded in the

application under Section 328 of the CPC and that he should be restored in

possession of the property in dispute forthwith. The learned District Judge is hereby

directed to take all necessary legal steps to restore the Petitioner-Appellant in

possession of the property in dispute. The Petitioner-Appellant is entitled to the

costs from the Plaintiff-Respondent in all three courts.

The Petitioner-Appellant is restored in possession of the property.
