Aluwihare PC. J

The Petitioner has filed the present Application seeking a declaration:

(a) that the 1st and 3rd Respondents had infringed the Petitioner‟s and/or

such other similarly circumstanced persons‟ fundamental rights

guaranteed under Articles 10 and/or 12(1) and/or 12(2) and/or

14(1)(a) and/or 14(1)(g) and/or Article 84 of the Constitution by

introducing amendments to the LOCAL AUTHORITIES ELECTIONS

(AMENDMENT) Bill in violation of the procedure established by law,

particularly in terms of the Constitution;

(b) that the 2nd Respondent namely the Speaker of the House of

Parliament had violated the Petitioner‟s and/or such other similarly

circumstanced persons‟ fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles

10 and/or 12(1) and/or 12(2) and/or 14(1)(a) and/or 14(1)(g)

and/or Article 84 of the Constitution by granting the certificate in

terms of Article 79 of the Constitution to the impugned Bill entitled

LOCAL AUTHORITIES ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL to become law;

(c) that the 3rd Respondent‟s opinion submitted in terms of Article 77 of

the Constitution that the LOCAL AUTHORITIES ELECTIONS

(AMENDMENT) BILL is ready to be submitted to become law is violative

of or had violated the Petitioner‟s and/or such other similarly

circumstanced persons‟ fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles

10 and/or 12(1) and/or 12(2) and/or 14(1)(a) and/or 14(1)(g)

and/or Article 84 of the Constitution;

4

(d) notwithstanding the enactment of the Bill entitled LOCAL

AUTHORITIES ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) the Petitioner and

similarly circumstanced officers are entitled in law to contest the

election and/or stand as a candidate at an election called for the

purpose of electing candidates for the local authorities.

When this matter was taken up for support, the learned Additional Solicitor

General appearing for the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Respondents raised several

preliminary objections with regard to the maintainability of this application in

particular the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to entertain and hear the

Petitioner‟s Application. The court, however, permitted the Additional Solicitor

General to raise, at the outset, the preliminary objection based on the time

stipulation in Article 126(2) of the Constitution, prior to hearing the Petitioner‟s

Counsel in support of his Application. It must be stated that the learned

Additional Solicitor General reserved the right to make submissions on the other

preliminary objections, subsequently. The learned ASG and the learned

Presidents‟ Counsel for the Respondents were heard on the preliminary objection.

The objection in the main was that the Application of the Petitioner has been filed

outside the mandatory period of one month stipulated in Article 126(2) of the

Constitution and on that basis, the Respondents moved to have this application

dismissed in limine.

Article 126(2) of the Constitution reads as follows:

“Where any person alleges that any such fundamental right or

language right relating to such person has been infringed or is about

to be infringed by executive or administrative action, he may himself

5

or by an attorney-at-law on his behalf, within one month thereof, in

accordance with such rules of court as may be in force, apply to the

Supreme Court by way of petition in writing addressed to such Court

praying for relief or redress in respect of such infringement. Such

application may be proceeded with only with leave to proceed first

had and obtained from the Supreme Court, which leave may be

granted or refused, as the case may be, by not less than two judges.”

It was submitted on behalf of the Respondents that in order to consider whether

the Petitioner has complied with Article126(2), relating to the stipulation of time

vis-à-vis the alleged conduct of the Respondents that the Petitioner is challenging,

the following dates would be of relevance:

It is common ground that the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill was

published in the Gazette on 02nd June 2017. The Bill thereafter, was placed on

the Order Paper of Parliament on the 20th June 2017. The Bill had been debated

in Parliament on 24th August 2017. After the Bill was debated, The Local

Authorities Elections (Amendment) Bill, together with committee stage

amendments, had been passed by Parliament on 25th August 2017.The Bill had

been certified by the Hon. Speaker in terms of Article 79 of the Constitution on

31st August 2017.

Accordingly, in terms of Article 80(1) of the Constitution, the Local Authorities

Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 16 of 2017 (P5) came into force as a law, on 31st

August 2017.

6

It was pointed out on behalf of the Respondents that the present Application of

the Petitioner has been filed only on the 13th of October 2017, which was more

than 30 days after, in relation to all of the relevant dates referred to above.

It was also pointed out on behalf of the Respondents that the Petitioner, in

paragraph (e) of the prayer to the Petition, has impugned the introduction of

amendments to the Local Authorities (Amendment) Bill at the Committee Stage

which had taken place on 25th August 2017, and in that context the Application

is time-barred by 18 days. Similarly, in paragraph (g) of the prayer to the

Petition, the Petitioner has impugned the opinion of the 3rd Respondent which

had been submitted, in terms of Article 77 of the Constitution, on the 25th August

2017. It was pointed out that the Application is once again time-barred by 18

days. It was also pointed out that in paragraph (f) of the prayer to the Petition,

the Petitioner is impugning the certificate endorsed by the Hon. Speaker in terms

of Article 79 of the Constitution on 31st August 2017.The Petition in that context

is time-barred by 12 days. When one considers the date on which the Local

Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 16 of 2017 came into operation, this

Application is time-barred by 12 days.

It was the contention of the Learned Additional Solicitor General that the

jurisprudence developed over time had made, the application of Article 126(2) in

respect of the time limit granted to apply to the Supreme Court on an allegation

of breach of fundamental rights, mandatory and not directory.

The learned ASG cited the case of Demuni Sriyani de Soyza and others v.

Dharmasena Dissanayake, SC 206/2008 (F/R), SC Minutes of 09.12.2016,

where Justice Prasanna Jayawardena PC held:

7

„Article 126(2) of the Constitution stipulates that, a person who

alleges that any of his fundamental rights have been infringed or are

about to be infringed by executive or administrative action may …

“within one month thereof” … apply to this Court by way of a

Petition praying for relief or redress in respect of such infringement.

The consequence of this stipulation in Article 126(2) is that, a

Petition which is filed after the expiry of a period of one month from

the time the alleged infringement occurred, will be time barred and

unmaintainable. This rule is so well known that it hardly needs to be

stated here.

The rule that, an application under Article 126 which has not been

filed within one month of the occurrence of the alleged infringement

will make that application unmaintainable, has been enunciated

time and again from the time this Court exercised the Fundamental

Rights jurisdiction conferred upon it by the 1978 Constitution.

In the case of Ilangaratne vs. kandy Municipal Council [1995 BALJ

Vol.VI Part 1 p.10] his Lordship Justice Kulatunga observed that,

“the result of the express stipulation of a one month time limit in

Article 126(2) is that, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an

application which is filed out of time – ie: after the expiry of one

month from the occurrence of the alleged infringement or imminent

infringement which is complained of,. ……. if it is clear that an

application is out of time, the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain

such application.”.

8

His Lordship further observed in the said case; “… the general rule

that had emerged is that, this Court will regard compliance with the

„one month limit’ stipulated by Article 126(2) of the Constitution as

being mandatory and refuse to entertain or further proceed with an

application under Article 126(1) of the Constitution, which has been

filed after the expiry of one month from the occurrence of the

alleged infringement or imminent infringement.”

This court, however, in exceptional circumstances where the Petitioner was

prevented, by reason beyond his control, from taking measures which would

enable the filing of a Petition within one month of the alleged infringement and if

there had been no lapse on the part of the Petitioner, has exercised its discretion

in entertaining fundamental rights applications and had not hesitated to apply

the maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia.

This principle was laid down in the case of Gamaethige vs. Siriwardena [1988 1

SLR 384], where Justice Mark Fernando set out the general principle and held

that, “While the time limit is mandatory, in exceptional cases, on an application

of the principle lex non cogit ad impossibilia, if there is no lapse, fault or delay on

the part of the petitioner, this Court has a discretion to entertain an application

made out of time.”.

If the facts and circumstances of an application make it clear that a Petitioner, by

the standards of a reasonable man, should have become aware of the alleged

infringement by a particular date, the time limit of one month will commence

from that date on which he should have become aware of the alleged

infringement:

9

In Illangaratne vs. Kandy Municipal Council, Kulatunga J held that; “…..it would

not suffice for the petitioner to merely assert that he personally had no

knowledge of the discriminatory act, if on an objective assessment of the evidence

he ought to have had such knowledge.”.

His Lordship justice Prasanna Jayawardena P.C in the case of Demuni Sriyani de

Soyza and others v. Dharmasena Dissanayake,(supra), referred to the burden

caste on the Petitioner, when an application is filed out of the stipulated period

referred to in Article 126(2) of the Constitution and stated:

„Needless to say, a Petitioner who seeks an exemption from the time

limit of one month stipulated in Article 126(2) of the Constitution by

claiming unavoidable circumstances which prevented him from

invoking the jurisdiction of this Court earlier, will have to satisfy the

Court that, he should be granted that exemption. In this connection,

Fernando J commented, in GAMAETHIGE vs. SIRIWARDENA [at p.

401], “… there is a heavy burden on a petitioner who seeks that

indulgence”. ….

The learned ASG referred to another principle that has emerged from the

decisions of this Court. That is the principle that, other than in limited

circumstances, time spent by a Petitioner in making appeals or seeking other

administrative or judicial relief would not, normally, be excluded when

calculating the period of one month stipulated by Article 126(2) of the

Constitution. Therefore, if, upon the occurrence of an infringement of his

Fundamental Rights, an aggrieved person does not file an application invoking

the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 126(1) of the Constitution but,

instead, choses to pursue other avenues of seeking relief, the time he spends

10

perambulating those avenues will not, usually, be excluded when counting the

one month he has to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 126(1).

In this regard, Fernando J in the case of Gamaethige vs. Siriwardena (supra) held

that;

“If a person is entitled to institute proceedings under Article 126(2)

in respect of an infringement at a certain point in time, the filing of

an appeal or application for relief, whether administrative or

judicial, does not in any way prevent or interrupt the operation of

the time limit.”.

In Gamaethige vs. Siriwardena, Fernando J referred to the principle and stated

that:

“Three principles are thus discernible in regard to the operation of

the time limit prescribed by Article 126(2). Time begins to run when

the infringement takes place; if knowledge on the part of the

petitioner is required (e.g. of other instances by comparison with

which the treatment meted out to him becomes discriminatory), time

begins to run only when both the infringement and knowledge exist

(Siriwardena vs. Rodrigo). The pursuit of other remedies, judicial or

administrative, does not prevent or interrupt the operation of the

time limit. While the time limit is mandatory, in exceptional cases,

on an application of the principle lex non cogit ad impossibilia, if

there is no lapse, fault or delay on the part of the petitioner, this

Court has a discretion to entertain an application made out of

time.”.‟

11

In paragraph 10 of the Petition, the Petitioner has averred that “it came to the

Petitioner‟s domain that, in or around 31st August 2017, the purported Bill which

had been subject to committee stage amendments in the manner above, had been

enacted as law and has been published as a Supplement to Part II of the Gazette

of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.”

Therefore, the fact that the impugned law had been duly enacted by Parliament

with Committee Stage amendments appears to have been within the knowledge

of the Petitioner by 31.08.2017. It was the contention of the learned ASG that, as

per the averments contained in paragraph 26 of the Petition, the Petitioner, in an

attempt to circumvent the provisions of Article 126(2), has claimed that he has

filed an application in the Human Rights Commission on this matter on 22nd

September 2017.

Section 13(1) Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No.21 of 1996

reads as follows:

“Where a complaint is made by an aggrieved party in terms of

section 14, to the Commission, within one month of the alleged

infringement or imminent infringement of a fundamental right

by executive or administrative action, the period within which

the inquiry into such complaint is pending before the

Commission, shall not be taken into account in computing the

period of one month within which an application may be made to

the Supreme Court by such person in terms of Article 126 (2) of

the Constitution.”

In terms of the aforesaid section, the period of one month in Article 126(2) will

have no application where an inquiry is pending before the Human Rights

12

Commission on a complaint made to it. Thus, the relevant period will not be

taken into account in computing the period of one month referred to in Article

126(2) of the Constitution.

In the instant case, the Petitioner has marked and produced the complaint he

had made to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka on 22.09.2017 (P6) and

an acknowledgment made thereon by the Human Rights Commission of receipt

of same. It was contended on behalf of the Respondent that although the date of

the said application is within a period of one month from the relevant dates

referred to hereinbefore, the complaint P6, is insufficient to establish that an

inquiry into such application was pending before the Human Rights Commission

during the intervening period. It was further contended that in terms of Article

126(2) of the Constitution read with section 13(1) of the Human Rights

Commission Act, it is the period within which an inquiry is pending before the

Human Rights Commission which is excluded from the computation of the

mandatory period of one month.

The scope and application of section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission Act

and the mandatory time period specified in Article 126(2) of the Constitution has

been considered in the case of H.K. Subasinghe v. The Inspector General of Police

and others, SC (Spl) No.16 of 1999, SC Minutes of 11.09.2000.

His Lordship S.N. Silva C J observed as follows:

“The Petitioner seems to bring the complaint within the time limit on

the basis that he made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission

of Sri Lanka within the stipulated time. In this regard the petitioner

relies on section 31 of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka

Act, No.21 of 1996 which provides that when a complaint has been

made within one month to the Human Rights Commission, the

13

period within which the inquiry into such complaint was pending

will not be taken into account in computing the period within which

an application should be filed in this Court.

The petitioner has failed to adduce any evidence that there has been

an inquiry pending before the Human Rights Commission. In the

circumstances, we have upheld the preliminary objection by learned

State Counsel.”

The same issue was considered in the case of Divalage Upalika Ranaweera and

others v. Sub Inspector Vinisias and others, [SC (F/R) Application No.654/2003],

S.C Minutes of 13.05.2008. In the said case, His Lordship Amaratunga J.

observed as follows:

“The second preliminary objection is that the petitioners‟ application

has been filed out of time. The acts resulting in the alleged

infringement of the petitioners‟ fundamental rights had taken place

on 23.09.2003. The petition has been filed in this Court on

5.12.2003, after the expiry of the time limit of one month prescribed

by Article 126 for filing an application for relief to be obtained

under that Article.

In their petition the petitioners have stated that they had made a

complaint to the Human Rights Commission on 22.10.2003, which

is within one month from the date of the acts resulting in the alleged

violation of the petitioners‟ fundamental rights. The petitioners have

produced the receipt dated 22.10.2003, issued by the Human Rights

Commission acknowledging the receipt of their complaint.

14

The time limit of one month prescribed by Article 126 of the

Constitution for filing an application for the alleged violation of

fundamental rights is mandatory…

In the written submissions tendered in answer to the learned State

Counsel‟s preliminary objections, the petitioners have sought to

invoke the aid of section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission Act

No.21 of 1996 to circumvent the time bar set out in article 126 of

the Constitution.”

Justice Amaratunga, having considered the provisions of section 13(1) of the

Human Rights Commission Act, went on to hold that:

“It is very clear from the section quoted above that the mere act of

making a complaint to the Human Rights Commission is not

sufficient to suspend the running of time relating to the time limit of

one month prescribed by Article 126(2) of the Constitution. In terms

of the said section 13(1), the period of time to be excluded in

computing the period of one month prescribed by Article 126(2) of

the Constitution is „the period within which the inquiry into such

complaint is pending before the Commission ……

…Thus the Human Rights Commission is not legally obliged to hold

an investigation into every complaint received by it regarding the

alleged violation of a fundamental right. Therefore a party seeking to

utilize section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission Act to

contend that „the period within which the inquiry into such

complaint is pending before the Commission, shall not be taken into

account in computing the period of one month within which an

15

application may be made to the Supreme Court‟ is obliged to place

material before this Court to show that an inquiry into his complaint

is pending before the Human Rights Commission.

…

In view of the failure of the petitioners to place any material before

this Court to show that an inquiry into their complaint has been held

by the Human Rights Commission or that an inquiry is still pending,

I hold that the petitioners are not entitled to rely on section 13(1) of

the Human Rights Commission Act to seek an exception from the

time limit set out in Article 126(2) of the Constitution.” (emphasis

added)

His Lordship Justice Amaratunga considered the scope of section 13(1) of the

Human Rights Commission Act in the case of Kariyawasam v. Southern Provincial

Road Development Authority and 8 others (2007 2 S.L.R. 33). Having noted that

there was evidence that an inquiry was pending before the Human Rights

Commission relating to the matters urged before court, held therefore, that the

Petitioner was entitled to the benefit conferred by that section.

The cases referred to above have been cited with approval in by her Ladyship

Justice Wanasundera PC in the case of Alagaratnam Manorajan v. Hon. G.A.

Chandrasiri, Governor, Northern Province in [SC Application No.261/2013

(F/R)], decided on 11.09.2014. Wanasundera J. held as follows:

“I am of the opinion that Section 13 of the Human Rights

Commission Act No.31 of 1996 should not be interpreted and/or

used as a rule to suspend the one month‟s time limit contemplated by

Article 126(2) of the Constitution…The provisions of an ordinary

Act of Parliament should not be allowed to be used to circumvent the

provisions in the Constitution.”

16

What needs to be considered in the instant Application is whether the Petitioner

has made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission to circumvent the time

limit imposed by Article 126(2) of the Constitution in view of the fact that, the

averments in paragraph 10 of the Petition, demonstrates that the Petitioner was

well aware of the impugned acts of the Respondents by 31.08.2017.

The document marked and produced as P3, the General Secretary of the Trade

Union in his letter dated 20.09.2017 (of which the Petitioner is the President)

refers to an Executive Committee meeting (of the Trade Union) held on

31.08.2017 at which the Petitioner had been authorized to file a case in the

Supreme Court with regard to the grievances that had arisen as a result of

enacting the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act, No.16 of 2017, which

had been passed by the Parliament on 25.08.2017. It was contended on behalf of

the Respondents that the Petitioner, therefore, was aware of the impugned Act as

far back as 31.08.2017 and had been mandated by the Trade Union to prosecute

the matter before the Supreme Court.

The Learned ASG argued that on the face of the documents produced marked P6,

the Petitioner appears to have made a complaint to the Human Rights

Commission solely for the collateral purposes of circumventing the time limit

prescribed in Article 126(2). In fact, the endorsement at the top of the complaint,

said to have been made by the Human Rights Commission, states that it has been

accepted as it is required for the purpose of filing a fundamental rights

application before the Supreme Court:

¶.re fY%aIaGdOslrKfha uQ,sl whs;sjdisluz fm;aiula f.dkq lsrSfuz

wjYH;djh u; Ndr.kakd ,os'¶

The learned Presidents‟ Counsel for the Petitioner argued that the above

endorsement is not the writing of the Petitioner and he cannot be held

17

responsible for an endorsement made by an official of the Human Rights

Commission. Even if it may be so, it would be reasonable to conclude that the

official of the Commission had placed the endorsement based on the knowledge

gathered from the Petitioner or else there cannot be a reason for him to have

placed that endorsement on the printed format (provided by the Commission)

that was used by the Petitioner to lodge his complaint to the Human Rights

Commission.

The Petitioner himself has relied on this document to circumvent the period of

limitation in Article 126(2) and had written in his own handwriting in two

places that he intends to go before the Supreme Court in the future:

"bosrsfhaoS fY%aIaGdOslrKfha uQ,sl whs;sjdisluz ¶bosrsfha fY%aIaGdOslrKhg hdug

lghq;= lrus' (Vide the responses to the cages 8 and 11 of the Complaint to

the Human Rights Commission ).

Therefore, it is clear that the Petitioner had not filed the said application with the

intention of pursuing it before the Human Rights Commission in seeking redress

but only to obtain an advantage by bringing the application within the provisions

of Article 126(2).

Cage 10 of the format used to lodge the complaint to the Human Rights

Commission, requires a complainant to state the evidence he expects to place in

order to substantiate his claim. The petitioner‟s response was , “will be

furnished in the future”. ("bosrsfhaos bosrm;a lrus”).

The learned ASG contended that, when the foregoing facts are considered, the

intention on the part of the Petitioner to circumvent the provisions of Article

126(2) is manifest.

As referred to earlier, the time limit of one month prescribed by Article 126 of

the Constitution to invoke the fundamental rights jurisdiction for an alleged

violation is mandatory. In a fit case, however, an application made outside the

time limit of one month stipulated in Article 126 could be entertained where the

18

delay had resulted due to a reason or reasons as the case may be that are beyond

the control of the Petitioner or where the court is satisfied that the circumstances

prevailed at the time relevant, it would have been impossible for the Petitioner to

have invoked the jurisdiction within 30 days and to be more precise where the

Principle lex non cogit ad impossibllia would be applicable.

In the instant case the Petitioner is not relying on any such disability and the

exception of time bar is sought on the basis that a complaint had been made to

the Human Rights Commission within one month of the alleged infringement in

terms of Section 14 of the Human Rights Act.

It is clear from the provision of the Act referred to above, that a mere act of

making a complaint to the Human Rights Commission is not sufficient to suspend

the running of time prescribed by Article 126(2) of the Constitution.

As held by this court, both in the case of Subasinghe vs. the Inspector General of

Police - SC Special 16/99 S.C minutes of 11.09.2000 and the case of Divalage

Upalika Ranaweera and others vs. Sub Inspector Vinisias and others – S.C.

Application 654/2003 S.C minutes of 13.05.2008, a party seeking to utilize

Section 13(1)of the Human Rights Commission Act to contend that “the period

within which the inquiry into such complaint is pending before the Commission

shall not be taken into account in computing the period of one month within

which an application may be made to the Supreme Court” is obliged to place

material before this court to show that an inquiry into his complaint is pending

before the Human Rights Commission.

It is, however, evident from what had been stated by the Petitioner in his

complaint to the Human Rights Commission, which I have referred to above, his

desire had been to invoke the jurisdiction of this court and not to have an inquiry

conducted by the Human Rights Commission.

19

In the above circumstances, I uphold the preliminary objection on time bar raised

on behalf of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Respondents and dismiss the Application

of the Petitioner in limine.
