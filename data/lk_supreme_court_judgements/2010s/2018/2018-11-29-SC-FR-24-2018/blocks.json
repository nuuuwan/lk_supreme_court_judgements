Instead, applicants are required to submit copies and then produce original deeds at the interview. The petitioners state that, at the time they submitted their application to the 1st respondent, the original deed of lease no. 2912 [for the then current period] had been sent to the Land Registry for registration. Therefore, the petitioners had no alternative but to submit with their application a copy of this deed of lease, which had been certified by the Notary Public who attested the instrument.

The petitioners also submitted with their application marked \u201cP4\u201d several other documents marked \u201cP6a\u201d to \u201cP6j\u201d.

He stated that, at the time the application marked \u201cP4\u201d was submitted, the deed of lease no. 2912 had been registered and was at the Land Registry. The petitioners state that, on 15th September 2017, they received a telephone call from the school requesting them to attend an interview on 17th September 2017. On that day, only the 1st petitioner was permitted to enter an interview room. The 1st and 2nd respondent and a few other ladies were in that room. The 1st respondent informed him that the petitioners\u2019 application had been rejected because the criteria set out in circular marked \u201cP5\u201d did not permit the application to be considered. When the 1st petitioner tried to produce the original deeds of lease including the original registered deed of lease no. 2912, he was not permitted to do so and the 1st petitioner told him that \u201cthere is no need to produce any documents\u201d. The petitioners aver that the 1st respondent \u201cdid not clearly explain the \u201cexact reason for the denial of their application\u201d. Thereafter, the Temporary List and Provisional List of children selected for admission to Grade 1 of Visakha Vidyalaya in 2018 was published in terms of clause 9.3 of the circular marked \u201cP5\u201d. The 3rd petitioner child was not named in the list. Therefore, the petitioners submitted the appeal dated 20th November 2017 marked \u201cP15\u201d to the 1st respondent, in terms of clauses 10 and 11 of the circular marked \u201cP5\u201d. The petitioners then received a notice dated 01st December 2017 marked \u201cP19\u201d summoning the petitioners for an inquiry into their appeal, to be held on 18th December 2017. It is seen that this notice stipulates that documents which were not produced at the interview cannot be produced at the inquiry into the appeal.

The petitioners attended the inquiry which was presided over by the 6th respondent. The petitioners were informed that the Appeals Board cannot recommend that the petitioners\u2019 appeal be allowed. Thereafter, the Final List of children selected for admission was published on 04th January 2018. The 3rd petitioner child was not named in the list. The petitioners state that the \u2018cut-off\u2019 mark for admission under the \u201cChildren of residents in close proximity to the school\u201d category was 60 marks. The petitioners plead that they were entitled to receive 68.5 marks upon the documents they had submitted with the application [including the current deed of lease no. 2912] and that, therefore, the 3rd petitioner child was entitled to be admitted to Grade 1 of Visakha Vidyalaya in 2018 under the \u201cChildren of residents in close proximity to the school\u201d category.",

They plead that, thereby, their fundamental rights under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution have been violated. The 1st respondent [Principal of Visakha Vidyalaya] filed an affidavit along with the documents marked \u201c1R1\u201d to \u201c1R5\u201d. She admitted receiving the petitioners\u2019 application marked \u201cP4\u201d on 21st June 2017 and admitted that the registered deeds of lease marked \u201cP1\u201d and \u201cP2\u201d and the unregistered deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3b\u201d were submitted with the application.

She also stated that the deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3a\u201d has been registered on 16th June 2017 as shown by the stamp placed by the Land Registry and went on to say that she \u201cbelieves\u201d the registered deed had been available with the petitioners at the time they submitted their application dated 17th June 2017 marked \u201cP4\u201d and, therefore, the registered deed of lease no. 2912 \u201ccould have been attached\u201d to the application. She averred that \u201cHowever, the petitioners failed to submit such lease agreement with their application and such failure to do so is entirely due to their own fault.\u201d. The 1st respondent pleaded that 710 applications were received to fill 83 positions under the \u201cChildren of residents in close proximity to the school\u201d category. She stated that the school was \u201ccompelled\u201d not to call the petitioners for an interview because \u201cthe Petitioners did not submit a registered lease agreement to establish residence at the address from which the school admission application was made.\u201d. The 1st respondent pleaded that, in any event, the Companies Form 40 marked \u201cP6i\u201d submitted with the petitioners\u2019 application states that 1st petitioner\u2019s residential address was No. 10, Vijithapura, Thalangama South, Battaramulla while the letter dated 30th June 2016 marked \u201c1R3\u201d written to the 1st petitioner by the Ministry of Education is addressed to the 1st petitioner at No. 444, D3, 1/1, Lake Road, Akuregoda, Battaramulla.

The 1st respondent averred that, at the interview held on 17th September 2017, the 1st petitioner submitted the registered deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3a\u201d which had not been submitted along with the petitioners\u2019 application marked \u201cP4\u201d.

The 1st respondent stated that the 1st petitioner was informed that the registered deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3a\u201d submitted at the interview held on 17th September 2017 could not be considered because only documents which had been submitted along with \u201cP4\u201d could be considered. She pleaded that the interview panel had acted in strict accordance with clause 9.1.5 of the circular marked \u201cP5\u201d which \u201cspecifically provides that the re-evaluation should be done on the documents submitted with the original school admission application.\u201d. The 1st respondent averred that the \u2018cut off\u2019 marks for the \u201cChildren of residents in close proximity to the school\u201d category was 61 marks. She stated that, as set out in the re-evaluation form marked \u201c1R4\u201d, the petitioner were entitled to only 57.1 marks. Therefore, the petitioners\u2019 application had to be rejected. The Appeals Board had confirmed this position when it considered the petitioners\u2019 appeal. The 1st respondent pleaded that she and the school had acted in strict accordance with the circular marked \u201cP5\u201d and the law and denied any violation of the petitioners\u2019 rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. In their counter affidavit, the 1st and 2nd petitioners stated that the current deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3a\u201d had been registered at the Land Registry on 16th June 2017 and, thereafter, the related entry had been made in the folios of the Land Registry on 17th June 2017, as shown in the Extract from the folios of the Land Registry marked \u201cP21\u201d. They said that the registered deed of lease was not in their possession when they posted their application dated 17th June 2017 marked \u201cP4\u201d.

In this connection, the 1st petitioner also produced, marked \u201cP22\u201d, copies of telephone bills sent to the Company at that address. Having set out the positions taken by the parties, I will now examine whether the refusal of the petitioners\u2019 application constituted a violation of their fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. In this regard, as I observed recently [in SC FR 412/2016 decided on 31st October 2018 with His Lordship, the Chief Justice and Justice Priyantha Jayawardena, PC agreeing], the complexity of the task which the circular marked \u201cP5\u201d seeks to accomplish must be recognized and this Court, in the exercise of our fundamental rights jurisdiction, would be inclined to question the provisions of such a circular only where the provisions are manifestly inadequate, unreasonable, arbitrary or unfair and, I would add, provided there has been no delay. Further, being well aware of the onerous nature of the task faced by officers who implement the provisions of such circulars and are called upon to balance the rights of a large number of applicants while applying the provisions of the circulars, this Court would be inclined to intervene and exercise of our fundamental rights jurisdiction only where the provisions of the circular have been ignored, violated, misapplied or misinterpreted or where there has been an abuse of process or a mistake which prejudices a child, or other similar grounds. In my view, the present application should be considered from that perspective. When doing so, it is first necessary to examine clause 7.2.2.1 (iii) of \u201cP5\u201d since the 1st respondent\u2019s position is that the petitioners\u2019 application had to be refused when the provisions of that clause were applied. Thus, the 1st respondent has stated that the unregistered deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3b\u201d was not considered by the school because clause 7.2.2.1 (iii) stipulates that, where an application is made under the \u201cChildren of residents in close proximity to the school\u201d category by an applicant who resides in leased premises, a registered deed of lease must be submitted with the application. Clause 7.2.2.1 [including clause 7.2.2.1 (iii)] states, inter alia: \u201c\u0db4\u0daf\u0dd2\u0d82\u0da0\u0dd2\u0dba\u0da7 \u0d85\u0daf\u0dcf\u0dc5 \u0dc4\u0dd2\u0db8\u0dd2\u0d9a\u0db8 \u0dad\u0dc4\u0dc0\u0dd4\u0dbb\u0dd4 \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db1 \u0dbd\u0dda\u0d9b\u0db1 \u0dbd\u0dd9\u0dc3 \u0db4\u0dc4\u0dad \u0dbd\u0dda\u0d9b\u0db1 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dc5\u0dd2\u0d9c\u0dd0\u0dbd\u0dda :-",

It is evident that the specification in clause 7.2.2.1 (iii) that a registered deed of lease must be submitted to establish residence in a leased premise is an attempt to introduce a safeguard which deters the execution of bogus leases to found applications for admission to Grade 1 of schools under the \u201cChildren of residents in close proximity to the school\u201d category. That is because the requirement of registration of a deed of lease makes it possible to subsequently ascertain, where considered necessary, whether there are concurrent leases of the very same premises - ie: an examination of the folios at the Land Registry will reveal whether there is another registered deed of lease which is concurrent with the deed of lease which founds the application. While the requirement of registration of a deed of lease may not be a foolproof method of eliminating bogus deeds of lease, it serves a useful purpose at the preliminary stage of determining the applications which are eligible for consideration when preparing the list of applicants to be interviewed. Thus, the requirement of a registered deed of lease in clause 7.2.2.1 (iii) is ex facie reasonable. Next, it is necessary to examine whether the 1st to 3rd and 6th respondents have ignored, violated, misapplied or misinterpreted the provisions of \u201cP5\u201d or whether there has been an abuse of process or mistake which prejudiced the 3rd petitioner child when these respondents refused the petitioners\u2019 application and appeal. When doing so, it is necessary to keep in mind that clause 7.2.2 read with clause 7.2.2.1(iii) states that, in such cases, the submission of acceptable registered deeds of lease with the application will entitle the petitioners to six marks if these instruments establish that the petitioners have resided at the premises bearing Assessment No. 26B, Fife Road, Colombo 05 for a continuous period of five years or more prior to 30th June 2017. The 1st respondent has made it clear that there was no difficulty in prima facie accepting the validity of the deeds of lease marked \u201cP1\u201d and \u201cP2\u201d which established residence at the leased premises from 01st June 2012 to 31st May 2017 - ie: a period of five years. However, the petitioners were denied any marks on account of the submission of lease agreements marked \u201cP1\u201d and \u201cP2\u201d because the deed of lease no. 2912 dated 06th May 2017 marked \u201cP3b\u201d - which is the copy of the current deed of lease covering the period when the application was submitted - was unregistered. Thus, it is clear that, if the current deed of lease no. 2912 was taken into account, the petitioners would have received a further six marks if the petitioners had been called for",

    "text": "an interview and produced the registered deeds of lease marked \u201cP1\u201d and \u201cP2\u201d and the registered deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3a\u201d at the interview. The 1st respondent has stated that the petitioners were entitled to receive only 57.1 marks on the basis of the documents they submitted without taking any of the deeds of lease into account. Thus, if the three deeds of lease were taken into account, the petitioners would have received a further six marks and ended up with 63.1 marks. The 1st respondent has stated that the \u2018cut off\u2019 mark was 61. Therefore, the conclusion has to be that if these three deeds of lease marked \u201cP1\u201d, \u201cP2\u201d and \u201cP3a\u201d were considered, the 3rd petitioner child would have been entitled to be admitted to Grade 1 of Visakha Vidyalaya in 2018. There is no dispute that the 1st to 3rd respondents initially rejected the petitioners\u2019 application and did not call them for an interview solely because the current deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3b\u201d submitted with the application marked \u201cP4\u201d did not establish that the deed of lease had been registered at the time of the submission of the application. It seems to me that the 1st to 3rd respondents acted correctly when they did so because there is nothing on the face of the unregistered deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3b\u201d submitted with the application which established that the said current deed of lease was pending registration at the time the application was submitted. In these circumstances, the 1st to 3rd respondents cannot be faulted for acting in terms of clause 7.2.1.1 (iii) and sending the notice marked \u201cP8\u201d informing the petitioners that their application had been rejected due to the inadequacy of the documents submitted to establish residence. However, when the petitioners received the notice marked \u201cP8\u201d, they made the entry marked \u201cP9b\u201d in the log book and wrote the letter dated 11th September 2017 marked \u201cP10\u201d informing the 1st to 3rd respondents that the current deed of lease no. 2912 had been sent for registration at the time of the application was submitted and that the petitioners now have the original registered deed of lease no. 2912 and are able to produce it at the interview. The petitioners also explained that they had despatched the application by registered post on 20th June 2017 without waiting to receive the registered deed of lease from the Land Registry because they were apprehensive of delays in the post resulting in the application failing to reach the 1st respondent within the time limit. Upon receipt of \u201cP10\u201d, the 1st to 3rd respondents have summoned the petitioners to attend an interview which was held on 17th September 2017.",

The 1st respondent has stated in her affidavit that the 1st to 3rd respondents refused to consider the original registered deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3a\u201d because they were of the view that the words \u201c(\u0dbd\u0db4\u0dbb \u0d85\u0dba\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dda\u0db4\u0dad\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dba \u0dc3\u0db8 \u0d89\u0daf\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0db4\u0dad\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db1 \u0dbd\u0daf \u0dbd\u0dda\u0d9b\u0db1 \u0db4\u0db8\u0dab\u0d9a\u0dca)\u201d in clause 9.1.5 of the circular marked \u201cP5\u201d prohibits them from considering the original registered deed of lease marked \u201cP3a\u201d. This leads to the conclusion that the 1st to 3rd respondents regarded the original registered deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3a\u201d as amounting to a \u201cnew\u201d document which was not submitted along with the petitioners\u2019 application and is, therefore, prohibited by clause 9.1.5. However, the 1st to 3rd respondents have failed to realise that the original registered deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3a\u201d which the petitioners sought to produce at the interview held on 17th September 2017 was not a new document. Instead, it is the very same document as the unregistered copy marked \u201cP3b\u201d submitted along with the application other than for the fact that \u201cP3a\u201d bears a stamp establishing that the deed of lease has been registered at the Land Registry on 16th June 2017.

The 1st to 3rd respondents have failed to realise that the placing of this stamp does not make \u201cP3a\u201d a \u201cnew\u201d document but only shows that the deed of lease which [as clearly stated in \u201cP9a\u201d and \u201cP10\u201d] was registered on 16th June 2017 and was at the Land Registry at the time the application was submitted. Thus, the 1st to 3rd respondents erred gravely and acted arbitrarily and unreasonably when they took the view that they were prohibited from considering the registered deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3a\u201d at the re-evaluation interview held on 17th September 2017. Further, the 1st to 3rd respondents have failed to comprehend that the particular circumstances in which the petitioners stated they were placed - ie: the availability of only an unregistered deed of lease no. 2912 at the time of submission of the application because the deed of lease was at the Land Registry - made it impossible for the petitioners to annex a copy of the registered deed of lease at the time they submitted their application marked \u201cP4\u201d. Thus, the 1st to 3rd respondents have failed to apply the common sense and equity reflected in the maxim nemo tenetur ad impossibile - ie: no one is bound to perform an impossibility. That omission on the part of the 1st to 3rd respondents was arbitrary and unreasonable and caused grave prejudice to the petitioners. The 1st to 3rd respondents have also overlooked the fact that the previous registered deeds of lease marked \u201cP1\u201d and \u201cP2\u201d together with the several other documents submitted along with the application marked \u201cP4\u201d constituted clear evidence that the petitioners resided at the premises from 01st June 2012 onwards and that, in this background, the high probability was that deed of lease no. 2912 had, in fact, been sent for registration at the time the petitioners submitted their application. The 1st to 3rd respondents failed to realise that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the petitioners should be given an opportunity at the re-evaluation interview held on 17th September 2017 in terms of clauses 9.1.5 and 9.1.6 of the circular marked \u201cP5\u201d, to produce all the originals of the documents submitted with their application including the original registered deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3a\u201d. It also has to be noted that clause 6.2.6. of the circular marked \u201cP5\u201d placed a duty upon the 1st to 3rd respondents to analyse and correctly understand the provisions of \u201cP5\u201d and reach an appropriate and correct decision after considering all the factors relevant the petitioners\u2019 application. In this regard, clause 6.2.6. stipulates \u201c\u0db4\u0dc5\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1 \u0dbd\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dab\u0dd2\u0dba\u0da7 \u0dc5\u0db8\u0dba\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0d87\u0dad\u0dd4\u0dc5\u0dad\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd3\u0db8 \u0dc3\u0db3\u0dc4\u0dcf \u0db4\u0dad\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dbb\u0db1 \u0dc3\u0dda\u0dd4\u0d9b \u0db4\u0dbb\u0dd3\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc2\u0dab \u0db8\u0dab\u0dca\u0da9\u0dbd\u0dba\u0da7 \u0dc5\u0db8\u0dba\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0dbd\u0dad\u0ddd\u0dbb\u0dcf \u0dd0\u0db1\u0dd3\u0db8\u0da7 \u0d85\u0daf\u0dcf\u0dbd \u0dc0",

Thus, clause 6.2.6 vested the 1st to 3rd respondents with ample authority and, in fact, a duty to adopt a common sense approach when they were faced with the unusual and, perhaps, unique problem presented by petitioners\u2019 application. However, instead of exercising that authority and duly performing that duty, the 1st to 3rd respondents appear to have acted mechanically when they refused to even consider the registered deed of lease no. 2912 marked \u201cP3a\u201d when the petitioners sought to produce it at the re-evaluation interview held on 17th September 2017. Thereby, the 1st to 3rd respondents failed to understand the purpose and effect of the provisions of clause 7.2.2.1 (iii) read with clauses 9.1.5 and 6.2.6 of the circular marked \u201cP5\u201d. The 1st to 3rd respondents failed to correctly apply these provisions at the re-evaluation interview held on 17th September 2017and, thereby, failed to achieve the purpose of these provisions Thus, the 1st to 3rd respondents erred gravely when they failed to realise that, in the unusual and, perhaps, unique circumstances of this particular case, the petitioner should have been given the opportunity to demonstrate, at the re-evaluation interview held on 17th September 2017 - that the deed of lease no. 2912 had been registered prior to the expiry of the time limit for submission of applications - ie: before 30th June 2017. The 1st to 3rd respondents have erred in failing to give the petitioners that opportunity. This failure on the part of the 1st to 3rd respondents resulted in them acting arbitrarily and unreasonably when they rejected the petitioners\u2019 application marked \u201cP4\u201d. The 1st respondent has also acted unreasonably and arbitrarily when she speculated that the original deed of lease no. 2912 would have been returned to the petitioners immediately after it was registered on 16th June 2017 and was, therefore, available with the petitioners when they despatched their application marked \u201cP4\u201d on 20th June 2017. By indulging in that speculation the 1st respondent has displayed a seeming lack of awareness of the reality of procedure that a deed which is registered at the Land Registry on 16th June 2017 is unlikely to reach the hands of the person who submitted the deed for registration within three or four days. Further, by seeking to use this speculation to justify the refusal to grant the petitioners an opportunity to produce the original registered deed of lease no. 2912 at the re-evaluation interview, the 1st respondent has unfairly and unreasonably caused grave prejudice to the petitioners.",

    "text": "The 6th respondent who chaired the Appeal Board which considered the petitioners\u2019 appeal has failed to correct the errors identified earlier. He seems to have simply gone along with the 1st respondent\u2019s erroneous decisions without duly performing the duty vested in the Appeals Board of correcting the errors and injustice visited on the petitioners by the 1st to 3rd respondents. Next, the 1st respondent\u2019s contention that the documents marked \u201cP6i\u201d and \u201c1R3\u201d give rise to a \u201cserious doubt\u201d as to whether the petitioners reside at the address stated in the school application - ie: in the second floor of the multi-storied building bearing Assessment No. 26B, Fife Road, Colombo 05 - is without merit. It is clear that these documents relate to the address of the 1st petitioner\u2019s company named Pinnacle Technologies (Pvt) Ltd and not to the petitioners\u2019 residence. In any event, if the 1st respondent had a doubt regarding the bona fides of the petitioners\u2019 position that they resided at the premises bearing Assessment No. 26B, Fife Road, Colombo 05, the correct stage for her to investigate the truth of the petitioners\u2019 position was at a full and proper re-evaluation interview at which she asked the petitioners to clarify any doubts she may have had. Further, if the 3rd petitioner child was selected and named in the Temporary List and Provisional List, the inspection which is done to verify residence in terms of clause 9.3.3 of the circular marked \u201cP5\u201d would have ascertained whether or not the petitioners resided at the stated address. The 1st respondent was not entitled to use her alleged \u201cdoubt\u201d to deny the petitioners the opportunity of a full and proper re-evaluation interview on 17th September 2017 at which all documents submitted by the petitioners, including the registered deed of lease no. 2912, were examined. The claim made in the 1st respondent\u2019s affidavit that the present application is time barred is also without merit since the petition has been filed within one month of the inquiry into the petitioners\u2019 appeal and, further, within two weeks of the publication of the Final List. Learned Senior State Counsel, correctly, did not seek to press time bar before us. For the aforesaid reasons, I hold that the 1st to 3rd and 6th respondents violated the petitioners\u2019 fundamental rights under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution when they refused the petitioners\u2019 application to admit the 3rd petitioner child to Grade 1 of Visakha Vidyalaya in 2018. The 1st and 2nd respondents are directed to admit the 3rd petitioner child to the appropriate Grade at Visakha Vidyalaya subject only to the 1st and 2nd respondents being entitled to first examine the original documents submitted with the petitioners\u2019 application marked \u201cP4\u201d and verify the authenticity of these documents. The 1st and 2nd respondents are directed to complete that process without delay upon submission of the original documents by the petitioners. In the event the 1st and 2nd",
