    "text": "children born of the marriage - two sons and two daughters. The defendant\u2019s mother owned a house at Gomes Path, in Colombo 4. The newly wedded couple lived there for a few years. Later, they moved to the defendant\u2019s parental home in Dehiwela and during this time, the house at Gomes Path was renovated. After the renovation was completed, the plaintiff and the defendant lived at this house at Gomes Path, from 1995 onwards. They both described that house as their `matrimonial home\u2019. On 28th September 2001, the plaintiff instituted action against the defendant in the District Court of Mt. Lavinia praying for a decree of divorce a vinculo matrimonii on the ground that the defendant was guilty of constructive malicious desertion. At the time the action was filed, the plaintiff was 40 years of age and the defendant was 43 years of age. When this action was instituted and during the course of the trial, both the plaintiff and the defendant continued to live in the house at Gomes Path, together with their four children. In this background, the plaintiff stated in the plaint that, from April 1995 onwards, there were frequent disagreements between the spouses and that the defendant and his mother harassed the plaintiff. The plaintiff also averred that, the defendant ill-treated the children of the marriage and failed to meet their needs. She claimed that, the defendant frequently abused, ill-treated and hit the plaintiff and the children and that he often instructed the plaintiff to leave the matrimonial home and that he threatened to eject the plaintiff from the matrimonial home and to divorce the plaintiff. However, in paragraph [8] (\u0d86) of the plaint, the plaintiff specifically averred that, despite these difficulties, the plaintiff continued to tolerate the situation in the interests of her children. Thereafter, the plaintiff made the following averments with regard to a specific incident which is alleged to have occurred on 07th July 2001: ie: that, on the night of 07th July 2001, the defendant, without any reasonable or justifiable cause, assaulted the plaintiff in an inhuman and ruthless manner [\u0d85\u0db8\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dd4\u0dc2\u0dd2\u0d9a \u0dc4\u0dcf \u0db1\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dca\u0daf\u0dba \u0dbd\u0dd9\u0dc3 \u0db4\u0dc4\u0dbb \u0dbd\u0daf\u0db1 \u0dd9\u0daf\u0dd3] in the presence of the domestic staff. The plaintiff stated that, the defendant then ordered the plaintiff to leave the matrimonial home and threatened to pour kerosene on the plaintiff and burn her unless she does so. The plaintiff stated that, on the following morning, she made a complaint to the Police at the Bambalapitiya Police Station. This complaint was marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 6\u201d at the Trial. The plaintiff specifically averred that, as a result of the aforesaid incident, the plaintiff was compelled, from 07th July 2001 onwards, to terminate all marital relations and connections she had been having with the plaintiff. Further, the plaintiff specifically pleaded that, from 07th July 2001 onwards, she and the defendant ceased to cohabit with each other and lived entirely separately from each other, but within the house at Gomes Path. She also pleaded that, all attempts made by her and her relatives and friends to resuscitate the marriage, failed. The plaintiff stated that the plaintiff and the defendant have not cohabited from 07th July 2001 onwards and up to the date of the institution of this action on 28th September 2001,",

    "text": "Finally, the plaintiff averred that, the defendant engaged in the aforesaid conduct with the intention of ending the marriage and that, accordingly, the defendant is guilty of constructive malicious desertion. In his answer, the defendant flatly denied the allegations made against him by the plaintiff in the plaint. He pleaded that the plaintiff has made these false allegations in her efforts to obtain a divorce from the defendant and alleged that, the plaintiff had made a false complaint to the Police on 08th July 2001. The defendant averred that, there had been some minor disputes between the spouses but that the defendant bore these difficulties in the interests of his children. When the trial commenced, the plaintiff and the defendant framed their issues based on the averments in the plaint. The plaintiff gave evidence. She did not call any other witnesses. Similarly, only the defendant gave evidence. A perusal of the judgment of the learned District Judge shows that he has considered the evidence, in detail. Having done so, he has observed that, the plaintiff has not claimed that, prior to 07th July 2001,the defendant had, by his deeds or words, sought to end the marriage or to eject the plaintiff her from the matrimonial home or to make it impossible for her to remain in the matrimonial home. With regard the alleged incident which the plaintiff states occurred on 07th July 2001, the learned trial judge observed that, although the plaintiff had stated in her complaint marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 6\u201d that, the defendant slammed the plaintiff\u2019s head against the wall, hit her with a torch and broken some furniture, the plaintiff has not made these claims during her evidence-in-chief. The learned judge went on to note that, although the plaintiff had stated in the plaint and in \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 6\u201d, that the defendant threatened to pour kerosene on her and burn her, the plaintiff has claimed, during her evidence-in-chief, that the defendant had, in fact, poured kerosene on her and tried to set her on fire. The learned judge noted that, the defendant had stated, at the Police Station, that he wished to continue with the marriage. The learned Judge observed that, despite the plaintiff\u2019s claims that the alleged incident was a grave one, she and the defendant had gone together to the Police Station on 08th July 2001 and returned together to the matrimonial home and that, the plaintiff has not asked the police to take any action in pursuance of her allegations of threats, assault and an attempt to set her on fire. In the light of these facts, the learned District Judge held that, the plaintiff had not proved the occurrence of the alleged incident on 07th July 2001, which is pleaded in the plaint. With regard to the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the plaintiff and the defendant had lived entirely separately after 07th July 2001, the learned District Judge held that, the evidence showed that, after that day, the defendant had his meals in the matrimonial home and that these meals were prepared by the plaintiff, the defendant met some of the expenses of the children and continued to contribute towards a part of the domestic expenses and utilities bills of the household and regularly supplied the household with rice and liquid petroleum gas. The learned judge concluded that this evidence showed that a degree of matrimonial relationship between the spouses had continued after 07th July 2001.",

(ii) Whether the Civil Appellate High Court erred when it held that the matrimonial relationship between the parties continued even after the institution of the divorce action and erred by disregarding the evidence led by the plaintiff which established that the parties did not recommence their marital relationship after 07th July 2001? (iii) Whether the Civil Appellate High Court erred by holding that the marriage between the plaintiff and the defendant had not failed ? (iv) Whether the Civil Appellate High Court erred by holding that the plaintiff had failed to establish that the defendant was guilty of constructive malicious desertion ? In this regard, it hardly needs to be said here that, section 19 (1) of the Marriage Registration Ordinance No. 19 of 1907, as amended, lists \u201cmalicious desertion\u201d as one of the three grounds on which a decree of divorce a vinculo matrimonii may be entered by a competent court. It is equally well known that, \u201cmalicious desertion\u201d may take place either by way of simple malicious desertion or by way of constructive malicious desertion. Simple malicious desertion or, as it is sometimes called, actual malicious desertion is where the spouse who is alleged to be guilty of malicious desertion physically separates from the matrimonial home or terminates matrimonial consortium, with the intention of deserting his or her spouse. The term \u201cconsortium\u201d usually denotes the composite incidents of a marital relationship. In GROBBELAAR vs. HAVENGA [1964 S SALR (N) 522 at p.525], Harcourt J described the term \u201cconsortium\u201d as \u201c\u2026.. an abstraction comprising the totality of a number of rights, duties and advantages accruing to spouses of a marriage.\u201d Harcourt J went on to cite Birkett LJ and observe that, that this \u201ctotality\u201d embraces \u201ccompanionship, love, affection, comfort, mutual services, sexual intercourse - all belong to the married state. Taken together, they make up the consortium;\u201d.",

    "text": "Constructive malicious desertion is where the conduct or speech of the spouse who is alleged to be guilty of malicious desertion gives his or her spouse no reasonable alternative other than to depart from the matrimonial home or to cease matrimonial consortium. In this regard, Gorrel Barnes J has commented in the early and often cited case of SICKERT vs. SICKERT [1899 Probate 278 at p.282], \u201cIn my opinion, the party who intends bringing the cohabitation to an end, and whose conduct in reality causes its termination, commits the act of desertion. There is no substantial difference between the case of a husband who intends to put an end to a state of cohabitation, and does so by leaving his wife, and that of a husband who with the like intent obliges his wife to separate from him.\u201d. This led Lord Merriman to pithily observe in LANE vs. LANE [1951 P 284 at p.286] \u201cDesertion is proved if the husband leaves the home, or drives the wife away from the home, with intent to bring the home to an end and without her consent or fault. It does not matter, therefore, on which side of the front door, so to speak, the spouses are found when they part.\u201d. The four questions of law set out above require this Court to examine the evidence placed before the District Court and then determine whether the High Court was correct when it affirmed the view taken by learned trial judge that, the plaintiff had failed to prove that the defendant was guilty of constructive malicious desertion. However, before examining the evidence, it is necessary, to ascertain what the plaintiff in this case was required to prove in order to obtain a divorce on the ground of constructive malicious desertion by the defendant. In order to do so and in the light of the need to carefully consider the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, particularly in view of the facts and circumstances of this case, this Court should examine the principles of the applicable Law. In this regard, the Marriage Registration Ordinance does not define the term \u201cmalicious desertion\u201d used in Section 19 (2) of that enactment. Therefore, one has to look at the decisions of the Courts to ascertain what amounts to \u201cmalicious desertion\u201d. The decisions of our Courts on this subject frequently refer to decisions of the English Courts which have influenced the development of our Law in this area. This led a learned author [Law and the Marriage Relationship by S. Ponnambalam - 2nd ed. at p. 6] to comment, with regard to the decisions of our Courts on the law of marriage and divorce, that \u201cIndeed (our) judicial decisions are replete with reference to English law authority \u2026..\u201d. A perusal of the decisions on malicious desertion in South Africa shows that the Courts in that country too, have referred to English decisions when formulating the South African law on malicious desertion. In this background, in addition to examining the decisions of our Court on malicious desertion, it will be useful to look at the decisions of the English Courts. When one does so, it is soon seen that, not only is there an, at times bewildering, multitude of cases where the English Courts have made pronouncements on malicious desertion, there are instances where it is difficult to reconcile the views that have been expressed in some of these cases. It is, perhaps, this, which led Lord Merriman P to observe, in WATERS vs. WATERS [1956 1 AER 432 at p. 437], \u201cI am not going to attempt the task, which would be difficult if not impossible, of reconciling all the recent cases in the Court of Appeal on these topics, or of reconciling some of them with some of the older cases.\u201d.",

    "text": "However, a study of the decisions of our Courts and a perusal of the decisions of the English Courts together with a reference to the South African decisions, does enable the extraction of some broad principles applicable to the question of what constitutes malicious desertion, in our Law. Firstly, it is evident that, broadly speaking, malicious desertion, whether it be simple desertion or constructive desertion, takes place when the following elements come together: the factum [fact] of physical separation when the spouse who is alleged to be guilty of malicious desertion deserts the matrimonial home or matrimonial consortium; coupled with animus deserendi [intention of deserting] on the part of that spouse. Thus, Lord Greene MR in BUCHLER vs. BUCHLER [1947 1 AER 319 at p.320] observed, \u201cIt is as necessary in cases of constructive desertion as it is in cases of actual desertion to prove both the factum and the animus on the part of the spouse charged with the offence of desertion.\u201d. In our law, Poyser J identified these two elements in ATTANAYAKE vs. ATTANAYAKE [16 Cey L.R. 206 at p. 207] when he cited, with approval, the statement by Gorrel Barnes J in SICKERT vs. SICKERT that, \u201cIn order to constitute desertion, there must be cessation of cohabitation and an intention on the part of the accused party to desert the other.\u201d. The term \u201ccohabitation\u201d used by Gorrel Barnes J means much the same thing as the term \u201cconsortium\u201d mentioned earlier. In PERERA vs. GAJAWEERA [2005 1 SLR 103 at p.107], Wimalachandra J observed that establishing malicious desertion requires proving \u201c\u2026.. not only the factum of desertion but also the required animus to repudiate the marital relationship \u2026..\u201d. With regard to the first requirement of the factum of desertion or, to use the words of Poyser J in ATTANAYAKE vs. ATTANAYAKE, the \u201ccessation of cohabitation\u201d, the spouse who is accused of having committed malicious desertion, should have committed the acts or said the words which are said to constitute simple or constructive malicious desertion, against the wishes of his or her spouse. As Basnayake CJ stated in RAJESWARARANEE vs. SUNTHARARASA [64 NLR 366 at p.369], the desertion must be \u201cagainst the desire\u201d of the deserted spouse. Consequently, separations by consent or by compulsion caused by an unavoidable requirement such as, for example, a spouse being deployed elsewhere by the armed forces, having to relocate for compelling business purposes or having to live apart for medical reasons would, usually, negative a charge of malicious desertion. However, it also has to be noted that, such consensual or compelled separation may later turn into malicious desertion if it is established that, at some point in time, one of the spouses changed the character of the arrangement and deserted the other. As Greene M.R observed in PARDY vs. PARDY [1939 P 288 at p.302], \u201cA de facto separation may take place without there being animus deserendi, but, if that animus supervenes, desertion will begin from that moment, unless, of course, there is consent by the other spouse.\u201d. A similar observation was made by Sansoni J, as he then was, in CANEKARATNE vs. CANEKARATNE [66 NLR 380 at p.382]. However, as observed later, these issues with regard to separation by consent or",

    "text": "compulsion do not arise in the present appeal and, therefore, need not be considered further in this judgment. A desertion may end if, before the deserted spouse commences an action praying for a divorce on the ground of malicious desertion, the deserting spouse reconciles and returns to the matrimonial home or resumes cohabitation or makes a bona fide offer to do so. Further, an unreasonable refusal of such an offer by the erstwhile deserted spouse may, in some circumstances, turn the tables and make the erstwhile deserted spouse a deserting spouse. Thus, in MUTHUKUMARASAMY vs. PARAMESHWARY [78 NLR 488 at p.493] Sharvananda J, as he then was, stated, \u201cTermination of desertion can take place by a supervening animus revertendi coupled with a bona fide approach to the deserted spouse with a view to resumption of life together\u2026.. The refusal of a defendant\u2019s bona fide offer to return which the plaintiff had no right to refuse converted the plaintiff into the deserting party and the plaintiff thereafter became the deserter and rendered himself guilty of malicious desertion.\u201d. A similar observation was made by Sansoni J in CANEKARATNE vs. CANEKARATNE [at p.382]. However, as observed later, these issues with regard to reconciliation and return do not arise in this appeal and, therefore, need not be considered further in this judgment. In cases of simple malicious desertion, the factum of the desertion is, usually, easy to identify and establish since the spouse who is alleged to have committed malicious desertion physically leaves the deserted spouse and the matrimonial home. Therefore, what remains is to ascertain that the departure was not consensual or for compulsive reasons and also whether there has been a bona fide offer to reconcile and return before the institution of the action. However, it is less easy to identify the factum of desertion in cases of constructive malicious desertion where the Court is, usually, called upon to decide whether the conduct or speech of the spouse who is alleged to be guilty of constructive malicious desertion gave the deserted spouse no reasonable alternative other than to leave the matrimonial home or to cease cohabitation. Thus, In ANULAWATHIE vs. GUNAPALA [1998 1 SLR 63 at p.66] Weerasuriya J [then in the Court of Appeal] stated \u201c\u2026.. when a party seeks a divorce on the ground of constructive malicious desertion what is required to be proved is that, the innocent party was obliged to leave the matrimonial home as a direct consequence of the expulsive acts of the other party.\u201d. A similar statement was made by Ekanayake J [then in the Court of Appeal] in FERNANDO vs. FERNANDO [2007 1 SLR 159 at p.162]. It will be useful to look at the question of what amounts to the type of conduct or speech on the part of the deserting spouse which will be regarded as \u201cexpulsive\u201d conduct or speech amounting to constructive malicious desertion. Adjectives such as \u201cgrave and weighty\u201d or \u201cgrave and convincing\u201d have been sometimes used when referring to the type of conduct or speech which justifies a charge of constructive malicious desertion. However, these adjectives do not, by themselves, help in identifying the nature of such conduct or speech.",

    "text": "Instead, in cases of constructive malicious desertion, the question that the Court is called upon to determine is whether the conduct or speech of the deserting spouse was of a nature which the deserted spouse, who is to be judged on the standard of a reasonable spouse who is in the marital relationship which existed in that particular case, could not be reasonably expected to tolerate and live with, in the light of the facts, circumstances and relationships of that particular case. As Diplock LJ, as he then was], stated in the Court of Appeal in HALL vs. HALL [1962 3 AER 518 at p.526] \u201cFor conduct to amount to constructive desertion \u2026.. the conduct must be such that a reasonable spouse in the circumstances and environment of these spouses could not be expected to continue to endure. This I apprehend is what is meant by such expressions as `serious\u2019, `convincing\u2019, `grave and weighty\u2019 .\u2026.\u201d . Diplock LJ wryly added \u201c\u2026.. although I await with some philological excitement an example of conduct which is `grave\u2019 without being `weighty\u2019.\u201d Thus, the type of conduct or speech which will justify a charge of constructive malicious desertion is limited to conduct or speech which can be reasonably regarded as being expulsive in the facts, circumstances and relationships of that particular case; and, therefore, excludes trivial or even annoying behaviour which a reasonable spouse in the facts, circumstances and relationships of that particular case, would be reasonably expected to tolerate and live with. Thus, Asquith LJ, as he then was, observed in BUCHLER vs. BUCHLER [at p.326] that conduct or speech which will be regarded as being expulsive and constituting constructive malicious desertion \u201c\u2026.. must exceed in gravity such behaviour, vexatious and trying though it may be, as every spouse bargains to endure when accepting the other `for better for worse\u2019. The ordinary wear and tear of conjugal life does not in itself suffice.\u201d. On similar lines, Diplock LJ observed, in HALL vs. HALL [at p,526], that, \u201cThe undue sensibility or eccentric phobias of the complaining spouse\u201d will not convert behaviour which \u201ca reasonable spouse would endure, albeit unhappily, as part of the wear and tear of married life\u201d into conduct amounting to constructive malicious desertion. To move on to the second requirement of the animus deserendi or, to again use the words of Poyser J in ATTANAYAKE vs. ATTANAYAKE, \u201cintention on the part of the accused party to desert the other.\u201d, the spouse who is accused of malicious desertion, whether it be simple or constructive, should have acted with the deliberate intention of finally terminating and repudiating the marriage and with no intention of resuming the marriage on some future date. Thus, in SILVA vs. MISSINONA [26 NLR 113.at p.116], Bertram CJ referred to the need for a \u201cdeliberate and unconscientious, definite, and final repudiation of the obligations of the marriage state.\u201d and added that the term `malicious desertion\u2019 \u201cclearly implies something in the nature of a wicked mind.\u201d. The learned Chief Justice went on to say [at p.116] that, the desertion \u201cmust be sine animo revertendi\u201d - ie: that the deserting spouse must not have the intention of resuming the marriage. In GOONEWARDENE vs. WICKREMASINGHE [34 NLR 5 at p.8] Garvin SPJ observed, with regard to malicious desertion, that, \u201cit must be of such a character as would justify the inference that the spouse who is alleged to have deserted the other did so deliberately and with the intention of repudiating the marriage state.\u201d.

    "text": "However, it is less easy to identify animus deserendi in cases of constructive malicious desertion since the intention of the spouse who is alleged to have committed constructive malicious desertion remains in the matrimonial home and his intention must be inferred and determined from his or her conduct or speech which is said to have caused his or her spouse to leave the matrimonial home or to cease cohabitation. In this regard, in BUCHLER vs. BUCHLER, Lord Greene MR went on to state [at p.320-321], \u201cIn the case of constructive desertion where there is no such significant act as the departure by the spouse who is alleged to be in desertion, the acts alleged to be equivalent to an expulsion of the complaining spouse must be of such gravity and so clearly established that they can fairly be so described. If they do not satisfy this test, not only is an expulsion in fact not proved, but it is not legitimate to infer an intention to desert. A man may wish that his wife will leave him, but such a wish, unless accompanied by conduct which the court can properly regard as equivalent to expulsion in fact, can have no effect whatsoever. Conversely, where the conduct of the required nature is established, the necessary intention is readily inferred since no one can be heard to say that he did not intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts \u2026..\u201d. There has been some controversy in the English Law on the question of whether the intention of the spouse who is said to be guilty of constructive malicious desertion is to be ascertained subjectively - ie: by proof that he or she did, in fact, have the intention of finally ending the marriage at the time of the impugned conduct or speech; or objectively - ie: on the basis that he or she must be presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences of that conduct or speech. In the case of BOYD vs. BOYD [1938 4 AER 180], the Court took the subjective view that, in cases of alleged constructive malicious desertion, it must be proved that the spouse who is accused of constructive malicious desertion did, in fact, have the intention of ending the marriage when he or she indulged in the impugned acts or speech. However, as stated earlier, in BUCHLER vs. BUCHLER, Lord Greene MR took a more objective approach and held that, a spouse who is alleged to be guilty of constructively malicious desertion must be presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences of his or her acts or speech which made the other spouse leave the marital home, even if he or she did not, in fact, intend to end the",

    "text": "marriage. In the later case of HOSEGOOD vs. HOSEGOOD [1950 66 1 TLR 735], Denning LJ, as he then was, sought to qualify the objective approach advocated by Lord Greene MR and stated that, when a spouse\u2019s behavior compels the other spouse to leave the matrimonial home, the presumption that such a consequence was intended is only one which may be drawn and not one which must be drawn and went on to hold that, that proof that the allegedly deserting spouse did not, in fact, intend to terminate the marriage, will absolve him or her of a charge of constructive malicious desertion. However, subsequently, in SIMPSON vs. SIMPSON [1951 1 AER 955 at p. 957] Lord Merriman disapproved of the aforesaid view taken by Denning LJ in HOSEGOOD vs. HOSEGOOD and followed the approach of Lord Greene MR in BUCHLER vs. BUCHLER that a spouse must be taken to have intended the natural and probable consequence of his own behavior. This divergence of views was addressed by the Privy Council in LANG vs. LANG [1954 3 AER 571].which was an Appeal from the High Court of Australia. The judgment of Lord Porter suggests that the Privy Council was of the view that: if the husband\u2019s conduct or speech is such that a reasonable man must know that it will probably result in the departure of his wife from the matrimonial home, the fact that the husband did not wish this consequence does not rebut the inference that he intended the probable consequences of his behavior and, therefore, intended his wife to leave home. In the later case of GOLLINS vs. GOLLINS [1963 2 AER 966], the House of Lords examined the decision in LANG vs. LANG and Lord Reid explained the import of the earlier decision [at p.974] stating, \u201cSo the decision was that if without just cause or excuse you persist in doing things which you know your wife will probably not tolerate, and which no ordinary woman would tolerate, and then she leaves, you have wilfully deserted her, whatever your desire or intention may have been.\u201d. Thus, the position in the English Law is that: a spouse who is charged with constructive malicious desertion is presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences of his or her conduct or speech which made the other spouse leave the matrimonial home, even if he or she did not, in fact, intend to end the marriage. The natural and probable consequences of the impugned conduct or speech are to be judged on the standard of a reasonable spouse who is in the marital relationship which existed in that particular case and in the light of the facts, circumstances and relationships of that particular case. Learned President\u2019s Counsel who appeared in this case have not referred to any decision of our Courts which has examined this question. I have not been able to find any such decision either. In my view, the aforesaid approach which is now used in England, recommends itself as a rational and equitable approach. I take this view because this approach, which I may term as being dualist in nature, succeeds in: objectively holding a spouse responsible for the natural and probable consequences of his or her conduct or speech; but, realistically, also takes into account the fact that, since the marital relationship is a very personal one, such behaviour should be subjectively assessed in the light of the relationship between the spouses.",

This limitation is reflected in the observation made by Innes CJ in WEBBER vs. WEBBER [at p. 246], that, a wife who \u201cleft her husband finally against his will and without legal justification \u2026..\u201d is guilty of malicious desertion - vide: also Dalton ACJ in RAMALINGAM vs. RAMALINGAM [at p.178] and H.N.G.Fernando J, as he then was, in ARIYAPALA vs. ARIYAPALA [65 NLR 453 at p.454].

Similarly two elements are essential so far as the deserted spouse is concerned:(1) the absence of consent, and (2) absence of conduct giving reasonable cause to the spouse leaving the matrimonial home to form the necessary intention aforesaid.

I have only sought to refer to some of the aspects of the constituent elements of malicious desertion and have not sought to attempt a definition of what constitutes `malicious desertion\u2019. In this regard, it has to be kept in mind that, as Sir Henry Duke [later Lord Merrivale P.] perceptively observed in PULFORD vs. PULFORD [1923 Probate 18 at p. 21], \u201cDesertion is not the withdrawal from a place but from a state of things\u201d. The nature of that `state of things\u2019 and the manner of the `withdrawal\u2019 will, naturally, depend on the two spouses, their relationship, their personalities and beliefs, their social and financial position, their past histories and hopes for the future, their families, their circumstances, their dwelling place and a myriad other factors. Consequently, malicious desertion can occur in a wide variety of situations and circumstances. Further, it has to be kept in mind that, the two constituent elements - ie: the factum of desertion and the animus deserendi - may not be readily identifiable as separate elements and, instead, be inextricably intertwined within the facts and circumstances placed before the Court. Quite obviously, the result is that, as mentioned earlier, what constitutes `malicious desertion\u2019 will vary from case to case. This makes it unwise to contend that a definition of `malicious desertion\u2019 can be formulated and applied across the board. In this regard, I would like, if I may, to echo the sentiments of Lord Jowitt LC in WEATHERLY vs. WEATHERLY [1947 AC 628 at p. 631] where he referred to several decisions on `desertion\u2019 and commented \u201c \u2026.. in all of them the judges have declined, in my view wisely declined, to attempt any definition of `desertion\u2019\u201d. Quite obviously, the question of whether the elements required to constitute malicious desertion have been established in a particular case are questions of fact to be decided by the Court upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. To now turn to the four questions of law before us, I will commence by considering the second question of law and fourth question of law since they are both founded on the principal issue of whether the plaintiff had successfully established that the defendant was guilty of malicious desertion. The second question of law asks whether the High Court erred when it held that the matrimonial relationship between the parties continued even after the institution of the divorce action and whether the Court disregarded the evidence led by the plaintiff in this regard. The fourth question of law asks whether the High Court erred by",

    "text": "holding that the plaintiff had failed to establish that the defendant was guilty of constructive malicious desertion. As set out in the aforesaid survey of the applicable legal principles, I should first examine whether the plaintiff had established the factum of malicious desertion. In this regard, as mentioned earlier, the plaintiff acknowledged, in paragraph [8] (\u0d86) of her plaint, that the marital relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant existed up to 07th July 2001. In fact, during her cross examination, the plaintiff confirmed that, \u201c2001 \u0daf\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dcf \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0dc4\u0d9a \u0dc3\u0db8\u0dca\u0db6\u0db1\u0dca\u0db0\u0d9a\u0db8\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd0\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dcf ..... \u201c. Thus, the learned trial judge correctly observed that, the plaintiff did not claim that the marriage relationship had ended prior to 07th July 2001. Instead, as set out earlier, the plaintiff\u2019s alleged case is that, the marriage relationship ended as a result of the alleged incident on 07th July 2001 and that, from that date onwards, the plaintiff and the defendant have not cohabited. With regard to this alleged incident, it has to be noted that, in her contemporaneous complaint to the Police marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd06\u201d, the plaintiff has stated that the defendant slammed her head against the wall, hit her with a torch, smashed the furniture, ordered her to leave the house and threatened to pour kerosene on her and burn her if she did not do so. Thereafter, in her plaint, that, the plaintiff has averred that, the defendant assaulted her in an` inhuman and ruthless\u2019 manner and that the defendant threatened to pour kerosene on the plaintiff and burn her unless she leaves the matrimonial home. It can be persuasively contended that, if such an incident did, in fact, occur, the plaintiff would have been left with no reasonable alternative other than to leave the matrimonial home or to cease cohabitation and, thereby, make the defendant guilty of constructive malicious desertion. As Weerasooriya J stated in BABUNONA vs. ALBIN KEMPS [67 NLR 183 at p.185], \u201cIt is hardly necessary to point out that under section 19 (2) of the Marriage Registration Ordinance (cap. 112), which governs the marriage of the parties to this case, cruelty per se is not a ground for dissolution of a marriage. But cruelty on the part of one spouse, which is of such a nature as to make cohabitation intolerable for the other, amounts in law to constructive malicious desertion by the offending spouse, and would on that basis constitute a ground for dissolution of the marriage at the suit of the innocent spouse.\u201d. It follows that, the success of the plaintiff\u2019s case is dependent on her succeeding in proving that the alleged incident did occur on 07th July 2001 in a manner similar to that described in the plaint. However, a perusal of the proceedings show that, when the plaintiff gave her evidence-in-chief, she did not state that the defendant assaulted her or slammed her head against the wall or hit her with a torch or smashed the furniture or threatened to pour kerosene on her and burn her. Instead, in her evidence-in-chief, the plaintiff only voiced an entirely new accusation that the defendant had, in fact, poured kerosene on her and tried to set on her on fire but was prevented from doing so by the domestic staff and her children. Thus, it was very clear that, the plaintiff placed, before the District Court, significantly conflicting versions of the alleged incident",

    "text": "which is said to have occurred on 07th July 2001. In contrast, the defendant, in his answer and in his evidence, steadfastly denied the occurrence of the incident. Further, the plaintiff did not call the members of the domestic staff or her children to testify regarding the alleged incident although she said that they had been present at the time. The plaintiff did not give any explanation for not calling these witnesses. The plaintiff did not produce any medical or photographic evidence which would show that she had been assaulted, even though it is likely that there would have been tell-tale signs if she had been assaulted in the manner she claimed in the plaint and in \u201c\u0db4\u0dd06\u201d. The plaintiff herself said that, she and the defendant had gone to the Police Station together and retuned home together. That is unlikely to be the conduct of a woman who has been gravely assaulted and threatened by her husband, the previous night. It is also significant that, the plaintiff did not ask the Police to take any action against the defendant with regard to an alleged assault or threat to burn her or, as she claimed in her evidence, an actual attempt to set her on fire. In the light of all these facts and circumstances, the learned trial judge held that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the alleged incident which she claimed as the ground on which the defendant is guilty of constructive malicious desertion and, accordingly, dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s case. The High Court affirmed this determination. In the light of the facts and circumstances I have recounted, I see no reason why this Court should take a different view. In this regard, there is much wisdom in the observation made Innes CJ in OBERHOLZER vs. OBERHOLZER [1921 AD 272 at p.274], which was cited to us by Mr. Sahabandu, PC who appeared for the defendant. Innes CJ stated \u201cThese matrimonial cases throw a great responsibility upon a judge of the first instance; with the exercise of which we should be slow to interfere. He is able not only to estimate the credibility of the parties but to judge of their temperament and character. And we, who have not had the advantage of seeing and hearing them must be careful not to interfere, unless we are certain, on firm grounds, that he is wrong.\u201d . In view of the second question of law, it is also necessary to examine whether, the conduct of the plaintiff and the defendant after 07th July 2001, supports the plaintiff\u2019s allegation of constructive malicious desertion. In this regard, it is relevant to first consider the impact, upon the plaintiff\u2019s case, of the fact that the plaintiff and the defendant continued to live in the same house at the time of the institution of the action and, thereafter, during the continuance of the trial. Learned President\u2019s Counsel who appeared in this case have not referred to any decision of our Courts which has examined this specific question. The only decision of our Courts on this point which I have been able to trace, is a case decided by the Supreme Court on 15th July 1881 and reported in SCC IV 107 [names of the parties are not stated in the Report]. In this case, Cayley CJ recognised that, in certain",

    "text": "A perusal of the decisions of the English Courts on this issue is useful. In POWELL vs. POWELL [1922 P 278], Lord Buckmaster held that, malicious desertion can exist even where the two spouses live under the same roof but in two separate parts of the house and have no dealings with each other. Thereafter, in SMITH vs. SMITH [1939 4 AER 533], it was held that, the fact that the parties are living under the same roof raises a rebuttable presumption that they are cohabiting but that this presumption can be rebutted by evidence that, in fact, the parties lived entirely separately though they happened to live under the same roof. In this case, the husband lived in the basement of the house and the wife lived on the ground floor of the same house but there were no dealings, relations or conversations between them. Sir Boyd Merriman P held that malicious desertion had been established. The approach taken in SMITH vs. SMITH was approved in ANGEL vs. ANGEL [1946 2 AER 635] and WALKER vs. WALKER [1952 2 AER 138]. In WILKES vs. WILKES [1943 1 AER 433], Hodson J took the view that, where the parties live under the same roof but, nevertheless, one of them allege malicious desertion by the other, it must be shown that the two did not share a \u201ccommon home\u201d although they physically lived under the same roof. In WANBON vs. WANBON [1946 2 AER 366], the Court held that, malicious desertion can exist even where the two spouses live under the same roof and not in two physically separated tenements but, in the words of Pilcher J at \u201ccompletely at arm\u2019s length.\u201d. In HOPES vs. HOPES [1948 2 AER 920], Denning LJ, as he then was, held that, where the two spouses lived under the same roof, malicious desertion can take place only where the two spouses have, in effect, ceased to share one household and have, in effect, set up two separate households under the same roof. Denning LJ stated [at p. 925], \u201cIn cases where they are living under the same roof, that point is reached when they cease to be one household and become two households or, in other words, when they are no longer residing with one another or cohabiting with one another.\u201d. This approach was later followed in EVERITT vs. EVERITT [1949 1 AER 908].BULL vs. BULL [1953 2 AER 601], NAYLOR vs. NAYLOR [1962 P 253] and LE BROCQ vs. LE BROCQ [1964 3 AER 464].",

The other two statements marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d and \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d were made by the plaintiff on 18th August 2006 and 20th July 2002 - ie: long after this action was instituted. Therefore, they are not strictly relevant to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, which was before the Court. In any event, the plaintiff has led no cogent evidence to support the claims she has made in \u201c\u0db4\u0dd07\u201d and \u201c\u0db4\u0dd08\u201d. The defendant has emphatically denied that there is any truth in the claims made by the plaintiff in these statements. The statements, by themselves, do not constitute proof of `cruelty\u2019 on the part of the defendant. The learned trial judge, who had the advantage of seeing the demeanour of the plaintiff and the defendant and hearing their testimony has held that, the plaintiff had not proved that the defendant was guilty of any form of `cruelty\u2019 to her. I see no reason to take a different view. The third question of law asks whether the High Court erred by holding that the marriage between the plaintiff and the defendant had not failed. This question of law appears to be misconceived since our law, as it now stands, does not recognize the irretrievable breakdown of a marriage or the failure of a marriage as constituting a ground for divorce. In any event, as set out earlier, the learned trial judge has held that, a degree of a marital relationship had continued between the plaintiff and the defendant while they lived under the same roof, after 07th July 2001. I see no reason to differ from that view. Accordingly, the first and third questions of law are also answered in the negative. In these circumstances, I am compelled to hold that, on an application of our law as it now stands to the facts of this case as were established by the evidence placed before the District Court, the learned trial judge was correct when he dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s case and the learned judges of the High Court were correct when they affirmed the judgment of the District Court and dismissed the defendant\u2019s appeal. Before I conclude, it has to be observed that, this is a sad case which has seen the parties locked in a long and bitterly contested battle over whether they should remain married or not. The wife sought this divorce in 2001, when she and her husband were both in their early forties. The fact that this appeal was fought by both of them suggests that, the unhappy marriage which led to this action being instituted has continued to remain so during the 17 years in which this case has traversed the Courts. It seems that the rancour between the spouses continues unabated. This litigation has seen the plaintiff and the defendant into their late fifties and has to have exacted its heavy toll on both spouses and their children. As stated earlier, on an application of the prevailing principles of law to the facts of this case, this appeal must be dismissed. The outcome is that, the wife must be denied the divorce which she has sought for 17 years and be compelled to remain in what she believes is an unhappy and unfulfilling marriage. The husband is left only with what appears to be the pyrrhic victory of an empty marriage.",

    "text": "The sole grounds for divorce in our law, at present, are the three grounds specified in section 19 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance, which are all `fault based\u2019. This led Sharvananda CJ to observe in TENNAKOON vs. TENNAKOON [1986 1 SLR 90 at p.92], citing Professor Hahlo in The South African Law of Husband and Wife, \u201cOur common law of divorce is based on the `guilt\u2019 and not on the` marriage breakdown' principle ....... Adultery and malicious desertion are breaches of the fundamental obligations flowing from the marriage contract, for it is of the essence of the marriage relationship that the spouses should adhere to each other, being physically and spiritually 'one flesh' ..... \". These solely `fault based\u2019 grounds for divorce set out in section 19 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance are derived from religious values which had prevailed in European countries and found their way into our Law with the advent of the colonialists to Sri Lanka. This was illustrated when Bertram CJ, in SILVA vs. MISSINONA, with his usual erudition, cited [at p. 115-116] a passage in Huber\u2019s Protectiones [Vol. III p.1203] (at p.115) which reads \u201cMoribus hodiernis sequimur ius divinum novi foederis, quo duetantum causae cognoscuntur, adulterium, item malitiosa desertio.\u201d and traces the origin of the concept of `malicious desertion\u2019 to the ius divinum [`divine law\u2019] which recognises two grounds for divorce - namely: (i) adultery and (ii) malicious desertion. I have ventured to obtain an approximate and perhaps inelegant translation of that passage into English, which would be: `by the covenant and customs of the present day, we follow the divine law, in which there are only two known causes, adultery and malicious desertion which is made with the intention of not returning to it, by means of which the bond of marriage is dissolved\u2019. Bertram CJ went on to observe that, the idea that the divine law sanctioned divorce only on these two limited grounds is found in the 15th verse [7th chapter] of St. Paul\u2019s First Epistle to the Corinthians. The learned Chief Justice also observed that these two concepts are embodied in section 20 [now section 19] of the Marriage Registration Ordinance No. 19 of 1907, as amended. The thinking that the `fault based\u2019 grounds for divorce set out in section 19 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance are sanctioned by divine or theological authority is reflected in the passage from Professor Hahlo\u2019s book cited by Sharvananda CJ in TENNAKOON vs. TENNAKOON and, much more recently, in ROSALIN NONA vs. JAYATHILAKE where the Court of Appeal said [at p.18], \u201cWe are not unaware of the saying that in order to put asunder what God has put together the Court must be satisfied that the intention of the parties was clear and deliberate that they wished to sever the bonds of matrimony.\u201d.",

It is telling that it was none other than the Archbishop of Canterbury who appointed the Study Group which submitted the recommendations set out in the \u201cPutting Asunder: A Divorce Law for Contemporary Society\u201d Report which led to the enactment of the Divorce Reform Act of 1969.",
