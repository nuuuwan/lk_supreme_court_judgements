ARGUED & DECIDED ON: 16.05.2018

Sisira J. de Abrew, J.

Heard both Counsel in support of their respective cases.

The Petitioners were recruited to the Sri Lanka Transport

Board on contract basis, and their contracts had gone on till December,

2015. The Sri Lanka Transport Board in October 2015 has taken a

decision to absorb the 06 Petitioners to the permanent cadre. This is

reflected in 2R5. But this decision has not been implemented and after

December 2015 the contracts of the Petitioners had not been extended.

The Petitioners therefore complained that their fundamental rights

guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been violated.

Under Section 11 (1) B of Sri Lanka Transport Board Act No. 27 of 2005,

the Sri Lanka Transport Board has the power to recruit security officers to

the Sri Lanka Transport Board.

According to the document marked „P7‟ which is the list of

security officers of the Sri Lanka Transport Board, the approved cadre of

security officers is thirteen.

It appears that in P7, 08 contract security officers (lady

security officers) had been included in the approved cadre of thirteen.

This includes the 06 Petitioners.

Thus it appears that the Board has the capacity to appoint

the 06 Petitioners as security officers to the permanent cadre. They have

in fact decided do so by document marked 2R5. We therefore hold that

the decision not to recruit the 06 Petitioners to the permanent cadre is

unreasonable and arbitrary.

For the above reasons, we hold that Sri Lanka Transport

Board (1st Respondent) has violated the fundamental rights of the

Petitioners guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

Considering all these matters, we direct the 1st Respondent

to recruit all 06 Petitioners to the permanent cadre with immediate effect.

The 1st Respondent is directed to recruit the 06 Petitioners to

the permanent cadre as security officers grade ix.

The 1st Respondent is directed to implement the direction

given by this Court within 02 months from the date of this judgment

(toady).

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT Nalin Perera, J. I agree. JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT Prasanna S. Jayawardena, PC, J. I agree. JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT
