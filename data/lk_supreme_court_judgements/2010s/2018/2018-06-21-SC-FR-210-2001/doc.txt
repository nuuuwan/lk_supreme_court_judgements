Sisira J De Abrew J. This court by its order dated 14.10.2009, granted leave to proceed for alleged

violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution. The petitioners have stated the

following facts.

The petitioners were appointed to the post of Grade III clerk in Sri

Jayawardenapura General Hospital during the period commencing from 1995 to

1997. When the petitioners were appointed to the post of Grade III clerk, there

were clerks already in the Sri Jayawardenapura General Hospital. The said clerks

had been appointed during the period commencing from 1984 to 1995 before the

petitioners were appointed to the post of Grade III clerk and they (the clerks

appointed during the period commencing from 1984 to 1995) had not been placed

on any grade when they were appointed. By a document dated 24.11.2000 marked

P5, the clerks in the Sri Jayawardenapura General Hospital have been graded into

three classes in the following manner.

Post Salary Scale

Class I T-2-5

Class II Segment A T-2-2

Class II Segment B T-2-1

The Sri Jayawardenapura General Hospital by the said letter marked P5, has placed

the Petitioners in Class II Segment B the salary scale of which is T-2-1. The clerks

who were appointed during the period commencing from 1984 to 1995 have been

placed on the salary scale of T-2-2 by the said document marked P5. Learned

President’s Counsel for the petitioners contended that as a result of the said

procedure introduced by the document marked P5, the petitioners would have to

wait for 20 years to reach Class I, but the clerks who had been appointed during the

period commencing from 1984 to 1995 would be in a position to reach Class I in

10 years. This was the argument of the petitioners. On the strength of the said

argument, the petitioners move this court to direct the Respondents to place the

petitioners in the same Grade of the other clerks who had been appointed as clerks

during the period commencing from 1984 to 1995. The petitioners also move this

court to direct the 1st to 10th Respondents to prepare a proper scheme of grading

according to law. The petitioners contended that their fundamental rights

guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been violated by the

Respondents. The petitioners have narrated the above facts in their petition.

The Respondents in their statement of objections admit that there are certain

mistakes in the document marked P5.

The petitioner’s application is to place them in the same grade of the other

clerks who had been appointed as clerks during the period commencing from 1984

to 1995. The petitioners have been appointed as clerks during the period

commencing from 1995 to 1997. If the petitioners’ application is allowed, a person

who had been appointed as a clerk in 1984 would be equal to a person who had

been appointed as a clerk in 1997. If the petitioners’ application is allowed, it

would be unreasonable by the clerks who were appointed as clerks in 1984. Such a

decision would undoubtedly affect the rights of the clerks who were appointed

during the period commencing from 1984 to 1995. They are not even before court.

It has to be noted here that the people who were appointed as clerks during the

period commencing from 1984 to 1995 have been in clerical service in Sri

5

Jayawardenapura General Hospital long prior to the appointments of the petitioners

as clerks. Therefore, it is unreasonable to equalize two categories now. For the

above reasons I hold the view that said application of the petitioners cannot be

allowed.

When I consider all the above matters, I am unable to hold that the Respondents

have violated the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed by Article 12(1)

of the Constitution. I therefore refuse to grant the relief claimed by the petitioners.

For the aforementioned reasons, I dismiss the petition of the petitioners with costs.

Petition dismissed.
