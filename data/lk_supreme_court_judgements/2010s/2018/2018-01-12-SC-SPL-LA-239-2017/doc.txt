Learned President's counsel submits that he filed a Revision application

against the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 13.10.2016 wherein he

decided to call for the defence of the accused. When the High Court Judge decided to

call for the defence of the accused, the accused filed a Revision application in the

Court of Appeal. This revision application had been fixed for hearing on 14.06.2017.

Learned President's Counsel submits that on 14.06.2017 he was absent in the

Court of Appeal for the hearing of the Revision application and the Court of

appeal has taken up the argument in the Revision application and

dismissed the said Revision application.

Learned President's Counsel submits that he was not able to be

present on 14.06.2017 as he has taken the next date as 16.06.2017. In support of his

contention, he has produced the file cover of the case that he maintained and his diary

which indicate that the case in the Court of Appeal had been fixed for 16.06.2017 but

not for 14.06.2017. When we peruse the file cover and the diary of the learned

President's Counsel that was submitted to the Court of Appeal, we are satisfied that

he has taken the date of the hearing of the Court of Appeal case as 16.06.2017. But the

actual date of hearing had been on 14.06.2017. After perusing the file cover and the

copy of the learned President's Counsel's diary submitted to the Court of Appeal, we

are satisfied that the learned President's Counsel had taken the date as 16.06.2017

mistakenly. When the case was dismissed on 14.06.2017, he filed a re-listing application

to relist the Revision Application in the Court of Appeal. He had filed a motion to the

said effect . When we consider the above material we are satisfied that he has produced

sufficient grounds to allow the re-listing application. When we consider the above

material,we are of the opinion that the Court of Appeal should have allowed the re-

listing application and also should have vacated the order made on 14.06.2017.

Considering the aforementioned matters, we answer the above questions of law in the

affirmative.

Considering all these matters we set aside the orders of the Court of Appeal dated

14.06.2017 and 28.09.2017. We direct the Court of Appeal to hear the Revision

Application of the Accused-Appellant on its merits.

We direct the Registrar of this Court to send a copy of this order to the Court of Appeal.
