Argued on: 06.02.2018

Decided on: 30. 10. 2018

Aluwihare PC. J.,

At the outset, it should be noted that all the Petitioners in SC FR 168/2010, SC FR

170/2010, SC FR 189/2010, SC FR 190/2010, SC FR 246/2010 and the parties

permitted to be heard in SC FR 246/2010 agreed to abide by a single judgment given in

respect of all the cases referred to above.

The Petitioners filed the present fundamental rights applications in March 2010 shortly

after being promoted to the rank of Inspector of Police with effect from 08th February

2010. The Petitioners were initially enlisted into the Sri Lankan Reserve Police as

Reserve Sub-Inspectors between the years 1989 to 1991 and remained in active service

in that rank for periods ranging from 13 to 21 years. In February 2006, pursuant to a

6

Cabinet Memorandum, police officers in all ranks in the Reserve Police who possessed

requisite eligibility and had no adverse disciplinary records were absorbed into the

Regular police. The scheme of absorption stipulated inter alia that officers in the reserve

cadre who possessed basic academic qualifications required for the Regular Force or

those who had served a minimum of 8 years active service would be eligible to be

absorbed. The said scheme further disclosed that those who are absorbed would be

placed just below their counter parts in the regular cadre.

Days prior to the Petitioners being absorbed into the regular force, namely on 06th

February 2006, a large number of Sub-inspectors who were then in the Regular service

or who had already been absorbed into the regular service, were promoted to the rank

of Inspector of Police purely based on the length of their service. The Petitioners could

not apply for this round of promotions as their absorption took place only on the 24th

February 2006.

It was only in September 2007 that the Petitioners were informed that their absorption

was in fact backdated to 1st February 2006. Since the relay of this message took place

nearly after a year, the Petitioners were prevented from applying for the aforesaid

round of promotions.

In the same month, i.e. September 2007, the Inspector General of Police called for fresh

applications for promotions to the rank of Inspector of Police. In contrast to the

previous round of promotions which was based purely on the length of service, the

present promotions were to be made on the basis of both seniority and merit.

[hereinafter referred to as the 2007 seniority and merit scheme]

Accordingly, the Petitioners duly submitted their applications, self-calculated the marks

and went through the interview process. They were confident that they had obtained

the required marks to qualify for the promotions.

In the meantime, several officers belonging to the Petitioners cadre filed a series of

Fundamental Rights cases numbered SC FR 330/2007, 331/2007, 347/2007,

348/2007, 358/2007 and a Writ Application numbered CA Writ 980/2007 seeking to

aggregate their service in the Reserve Police and the service in the Regular Police to

7

fulfil the required years of service to be eligible for promotion to the rank of Inspector

of Police under the promotion scheme.

The Court of Appeal in the aforesaid CA Writ 980/2007 issued an interim order

staying the grant of promotions under the 2007 Seniority and Merit scheme till the

cases were resolved.

An out of court settlement was reached among the several parties, in 2010, to promote

the Petitioners in the aforesaid SC FR 330/2007, 331/2007, 347/2007, 348/2007,

358/2007 and CA Writ 980/2007, to the rank of Inspector of Police purely based on

the length of their service.

This batch of promotees included those who duly qualified under the 2007 Seniority

and Merit scheme and those who got in based on the length of service pursuant to the

out of court settlement. Since the out of Court settlement took nearly 3 years, these

promotions were backdated to take effect from the 25th of September 2007-the day on

which the applications were called.

As a considerable number of vacancies, which were initially reserved for the successful

candidates under the promotion scheme, were thus filled by the promotees pursuant to

the out of court settlement, the promoting authority had to increase the cut off marks to

choose candidates for the remaining vacancies. This unavoidable development resulted

in prejudicing the present petitioners as they could not meet the high cut off mark and

thereby became ineligible under the promotion scheme.

Naturally, the aforesaid state of affair caused frustration among police officers and His

Excellency the President subsequently intervened and directed that all Sub-Inspectors of

Police who had completed 8 years of service be promoted to the rank of Inspector of

Police with effect from 8th February 2010.

It was pursuant to the said intervention that the present Petitioners received their

promotions to the rank of Inspector of Police with effect from 8th February 2010.

However, the Petitioner still had an outstanding grievance as they received their

promotions with effect from 2010 whereas several officers, who obtained lower marks

8

than them under the promotion scheme, received their promotions with effect from

September 2007 pursuant to the out of court settlement.

When this case was taken for hearing, the Public Service Commission (the appointing

authority at that point) indicated that they could arrive at an out of court settlement.

Accordingly, by a motion dated 17th March 2014, the PSC filed three documents

marked respectively as A, B and C whereby the PSC brought to the attention of

the Court the basis of the settlement, the conditions and the list of petitioners whose

promotions could be backdated to 25th September 2007. The aforesaid list of

petitioners whose promotions could be backdated is reflected in the document marked

C filed by the motion dated 17th March 2014. The document marked C is a

composite document that carries the names of those who are eligible to have their

promotions backdated (in each of the present cases) and those who are not. Hereinafter,

the officers who have been recognized in the said document C as being eligible to

have their promotions backdated will be referred to as eligible petitioners. On 12th

November 2014, the Court has agreed to accept the said motion dated 17th March

2014 as the basis of settlement.

Therefore, the remaining question, viz a viz, the settlement is to see whether backdating

should be done on a notional basis. In the event this Court were to hold so, it would not

allow the Petitioners to count the backdated years for the purposes of future promotions

and would leave them with only the actual service to be made eligible for future

promotions.

Prior to addressing the above issue, I wish to first address the preliminary objection

raised by the learned Senior State Counsel against the following Petitions for

intervention in SC FR 246/2010. These Petitions include the Petition dated

12/09/2012 filed by Mr. Asthika Devendra, the petitions dated 02/05/2011, 26/ 08/

2011 and 28/11/2011 filed by Mr. Upul Kumarapperuma and a motion dated

03/12/2014 filed by Mr. Senany Dayarathne.

The learned Senior State Counsel objected to the said Applications on 12. 05. 2016

stating that they were filed out of time. A perusal of the journal entry on 12.05.2016 in

9

SC FR 246/2010 indicates that the Court has allowed the aforesaid Counsel to make

submissions. No order permitting intervention has been made.

The several intervenient petitioners have come before this Court claiming the same

relief i.e. to have their promotions backdated to 27th September 2010. The alleged

violation, against which they have come before this Court, had taken place in February

2010. However, I observe that they have filed their intervention papers respectively in

2011, 2012 and 2014several years after the alleged violation. Prima facie, their

applications fall outside the time period stipulated under Article 126 (2) of the

Constitution.

Nevertheless, it is accepted that a preliminary objection on time bar should be taken at

the earliest opportunity. In Ranaweera v Sub-Inspector Wilson Siriwardena and Others

[2008] 1 SLR 260 it was held that;

In a fundamental rights application, the first opportunity available to a respondent to

put forward any defence available to him including the plea of time bar is the stage at

which he has to file his objections after the Court has granted leave to proceed

In the present instance, leave to proceed for Application SC FR 246/2010 was granted

on 06. 09. 2012. On the said day, Counsel for Intervenient-Petitioners in Petitions dated

respectively, 12/09/2012 (Mr. Asthika Devendra) and 02/05/2011 and 28/11/2011

(Mr. Upul Kumarapperuma) had informed the Court that they have filed papers for

intervention. The observation made by the Court as shown in the journal entry is as

follows;

Mr. Kumarapperuma and Mr. Devendra inform Court that they have filed papers to

intervene in this application. Mr. Kumarapepruma inform Court that there are two

applications for intervention and all together there would be seven Intervenient-

Petitioners. Mr. Devendra informs the Court that he has one Petition which consists of

20 petitioners. Mr. Devendra further submits that he will have to amend those papers

and after the amendment there would be 15 intervenient petitioners. The said papers to

be sent to the Learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned senior state counsel

within one week form today. No further interventions would be allowed in this

10

application or in any other connected applications since this matter has been pending

since 2010 and these matters will have to be concluded

On 06. 05. 2016, the Court has again fixed these petitions for support for intervention.

By this time, the last batch of Petitioners seeking to be heard (the petitioners in the

Petition dated 03.12.2014 represented by Mr. Senany Dayarathne) had filed papers for

intervention. On 12.05.2016 parties were heard in relation to intervention and I

observe that the learned Senior State Counsel on that occasion has raised a preliminary

objection on time bar.

According to the above sequence of events, the Court, most likely due to an oversight,

has on two occasions proceeded to hear parties on the issue of intervention. It appears

to me that the observation made by this Court on 06. 09. 2012 suggests that the Court

permitted the Petitioners in petitions dated 12/09/2012 (represented by Mr. Asthika

Devendra) 02/05/2011, 26/ 08/ 2011 and 28/ 11/ 2011 (represented by Mr. Upul

Kumarapperuma) to intervene in the proceedings, on the same day leave to proceed

was granted. The aforesaid Petitioners have appeared before the Court and have time to

time appraised the Court on the progress of the settlement process. Accordingly, I do

not think the learned Senior State Counsel could take up the position 4 years later that

those intervening Petitions are filed out of time. In fact, it would be inequitable to do so.

However, the said objection remains valid in relation to the Petitioners seeking to

intervene through the Petition dated 03.12.2014. According to Ranaweera v Sub-

Inspector Wilson Siriwardena and Others (supra);

A time bar or prescription which affects jurisdiction of Court must be specifically

pleaded in the very first opportunity and if it is not so pleaded, the Court is entitled to

proceed on the basis that the respondent has waived his right to raise the defence of

time bar in defence of the claim raised against him.

It was only on 12. 05. 2016 that the Court for the first time heard the Petitioners in the

Petition dated 03. 12. 2012 (represented by Mr. Senany Dayarathne) in support of the

intervention. As I have already adverted to, the learned Senior State Counsel has raised

the objection on the very first opportunity that the papers have been filed out of time.

11

I further observe that the Petitioners in the said Petition dated 03. 12. 2014 have filed

their Petition after the settlement has been arrived between the parties and approved by

this Court. (by motions dated 17th March 2014, the PSC brought to the attention of the

Court a list of petitioners whose promotions could be backdated to 25th September

2007. On 12th November 2014, the Court ordered that the said motion dated 17th

March 2014 be accepted as the basis of settlement). Thus, there can be no question that

the motion for intervention dated 03. 12. 2014 has been filed out of time.

It must be stated that the Supreme Court has consistently held in a number of cases

involving alleged violation of fundamental rights that the time limit within which an

application for relief for any fundamental right or language right violation may be filed

is mandatory and must be complied with. (See Edirisuriya Vs. Navaratnam [1985] 1

SLR 100, Illangaratne Vs. Kandy Municipal Council [1995] BALJ Vol.VI Part 1 p.10) In

a fit case, however, the Court would entertain an application made outside the time

limit provided an adequate excuse for the delay could be adduced.

The learned Counsel for the party seeking to be heard has stated in their written

submission that the Petitioners have pursued other avenues of redressal such as lodging

a complaint in the Human Rights Commission and appealing to the Inspector General

of Police. Proof of said complaints are produced marked X4(a) and X4(b) respectively.

It must be borne in mind that it is only section 13 (1) of the Human Rights Commission

of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 that has the power to interrupt the passage of time in

Article 126 (2) of the Constitution. As Justice Fernando enunciated in Gamathige v

Siriwardena [1998] 1 SLR 384 pursuing other avenues per se does not interrupt the

time.

If a person is entitled to institute proceedings under Article 126(2) in respect of an

infringement at a certain point of time, the filing of an appeal or an application for

relief, whether administrative or judicial, does not in any way prevent or interrupt the

operation of the time-limit. [] The Constitution provides for a sure and. expeditious

remedy, in the highest Court, to be granted according to law, and not subject to the

uncertain discretion of the very Executive of whose act the aggrieved person complains;

if he decides to pursue other remedies, particularly administrative remedies, the lapse

12

of time will (save in very exceptional circumstances) result in the former remedy

becoming unavailable to him.

The Petitioners have complained to the Human Rights Commission on or before 5th

March 2010. On 5th March 2010 (X4(a)) the Human Rights Commission has informed

the Petitioners that the Commission commenced an inquiry into the complaint.

However, over and above this document, the Petitioners have not stated what became of

the inquiry thereafter. The Petition for intervention is dated 3rd December 20144

years after the commencement of the said inquiryand there is no material to see

whether the investigation has been concluded and if so, at which point. I also observe

that the Petitioners seeking intervention have already invoked this Courts Jurisdiction

in respect of the same matter and have sought the same reliefs in SC FR 193/2012. In

paragraph 22 of the Petition in SC FR 193/2012, the Petitioners have stated that the

Human Rights Investigation was pending at the time of invoking the Courts

Jurisdiction. In contrast, it is stated in paragraph 5(a) of the present Petition for

intervention, that We, along with several others similarly circumstanced, complained

to the Human Rights Commission by complaint dated 5th March 2010, bearing number

HRC 898/2010, which was to no avail. In the absence of any evidence indicating the

continuance of the inquiry, I could only construe that the investigation may have

concluded after 2012. Furthermore, as adverted to above, the Petitioners have invoked

this Courts jurisdiction in respect of the same matter in SC FR 193/2012. On their own

admission leave to proceed has been refused in the first instance. By filing papers for

intervention in the present case, they have sought to achieve indirectly what they have

been unable to achieve directly.

In these circumstances, I am inclined to believe that the Petition dated 03. 12. 2014 for

intervention has in fact been filed out of time. The only instance, if at all, which could

compel the Court to allow an Application filed out of time is when the circumstances

clearly give rise to a situation of lex non cogit ad impossibilia. Even in such

circumstances, the Court must look to see that there is no lapse, fault or delay on the

part of the petitioner. With regard to the Petition dated 03. 12 2014, I observe no such

circumstances that could have prevented the Petitioners seeking to be heard from filing

their papers for intervention before 2014.

13

For the foregoing reasons, I uphold the preliminary objection against the Petitioners in

the petition dated 03. 12. 2014. However, I wish to emphasize that this dismissal does

not in any manner preclude the Authorities from considering the grievances of the

Petitioners in the Petition dated 03. 12. 2014 and providing administrative relief where

possible.

With that I proceed to answer the main issue whether the promotions of the eligible

petitioners named in document marked C filed by the motion dated 17th March

2014 should be antedated on a notional basis.

The learned Senior State Counsel placed great reliance on SC FR 94/2002 in which the

Supreme Court has ruled that backdating must be done on a notional basis. However, in

the said case, the Court arrived at that decision based on the facts peculiar to that case.

The opinion of the Court in that case reflected the rationale in the Cabinet

Memorandum which clearly stipulated that promotions to Class I of the SLEAS should

be made in strict compliance of the applicable service minute. i.e. In order to be

qualified to hold a permanent post, promotions will have to be obtained in accordance

with the relevant schemes of promotions, e.g. passing a competitive examination or on

merit .

In any event, parties to the said case did not dispute the notional date of appointment.

The issue was the purported cancellation of all appointments made on that basis as

oppose to pronouncing on the acceptability of the notional basis. The Court quashed the

decision to cancel the appointments and ordered that all future promotions be given

based on the requirements in the promotion scheme. The Court when pronouncing the

decision in the above case did not lay down as a principle that backdating must always

be notional.

In those circumstances I do not believe that SC FR 94/2002 can be taken as decisive

authority for issues involving antedating.

In the present case, it is undisputed that the eligible petitioners are equally

circumstanced as Petitioners in the previous cases (who received their promotions

backdated on account of the out of court settlement). They were absorbed into the

14

regular force along with the petitioners of the previous cases. The only differentiating

factor between the two groups is the date on which they received their respective

promotions. The former group received it on 25th September 2007 while the present

eligible petitioners received it on 02nd February 2010. However, this difference was

effectuated not based on any overarching rational policy but due to the interplay of

certain circumstances.

I am mindful that at the inception, the Petitioners were blanketly claiming to have their

promotions backdated while the previous petitioners who received their promotion in

2007 had to go through a review process by the PSC. However, it has been brought to

the attention of the Court that the present settlement was arrived at pursuant to a

criterion approved by the Inspector General of Police and the Public Service

Commission and later endorsed and adopted by the National Police Commission.

Accordingly, 300 individuals who have scored above 28.5 marks at the interview, and

those who (i) are confirmed in their rank (ii) possess six years of active service (iii)

have an unblemished record of service in the last five years and (iv) have passed the

first aid examination, would qualify to have their promotions antedated. They will not

receive back wages and their seniority will be determined according to the marks they

received at the interview. This settlement along with the names of the eligible

petitioners [document marked C], has been produced by the Respondents by a motion

dated 17. 03. 2014. The National Police Commission by motion dated 5th October 2016

has endorsed the said settlement.

Thus, it appears that the antedating of promotions would take place on a rational basis

which would favor only the most eligible candidates.

In those circumstances, the only outstanding concern which, if at all, could have had

the effect of placing the present petitioners on a different footing has been nullified. In

my opinion, the eligible petitioners in the list marked C in the motion dated 17th

March 2014, are equal and perhaps more deserving of the promotions than the

Petitioners in the previous cases. There is nothing that militates against giving them the

same privileges that the petitioners in the previous cases were entitled to.

15

On the contrary, if this Court were to artificially deprive the Petitioners from

aggregating their services for future promotions, it would create an anomaly for which

no reasonable explanation could be given. It would render nugatory a process of

negotiations which had run a course of 8 years and more particularly permit a

classification which is unsupported by any intelligible differentia.

In this regard it is pertinent to note Justice Amerasinghes observation in Ragunathan V.

Jayawardene, Secretary, Ministry of Transport and Highways and Others [1994] 2 SLR

255 that;

The public services exist to supply an efficient administration and Article 12 of the

Constitution does not preclude the imposition of qualifying examinations, selective tests

and other criteria for selecting or promoting public officers to assure efficiency. The

distinction between those qualified for promotion and those who were not was

therefore founded upon an intelligible differentia. It was rational. The scheme of

promotion was not arbitrary or artificial or evasive in its formulation or relation to its

purpose or in its application.

In matters relating to promotions, as it is the case in all other instances impugned under

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution, there ought to be a rational, an intelligible basis

which permits differentiation. That is the only form of classification which law

recognizes.

In the present instance, the mere fact that the present petitioners chose to follow the

2007 Promotion scheme instead of resorting to litigation does not place them in a

category different to the one which the Petitioners in the previous cases belonged. As

has been clearly demonstrated in the well known case of Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice

Tendolkadz A. I. R. 1958 S.C. 538, classifications are permitted provided that the

classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguish persons

that are grouped in from others who are left out of the group

If the eligible petitioners in Document C in the motion dated 14th March 2014,

were less qualified or had no merit, this Court undoubtedly would have come to a

different conclusion. However, as demonstrated, these eligible petitioners have

16

obtained marks higher than 28.5 and rightfully earned their promotions under the

2007 promotion scheme; yet due to factors beyond their control, they were deprived of

claiming that benefit. They have come before this Court requesting to be instated in the

position which they would have otherwise received. In those circumstances, if this

Court were to hold that the shortlisted eligible petitioners would only be entitled to

have their promotions backdated on a notional basis, it would place them in a different

category purely because they decided against litigating in 2007. Needless to say, such a

classification would not be intelligible within the meaning of Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution.

It has also been brought to our attention that section 1:11:2 of Chapter II of the

Establishment Code and the PSC Procedural Rules 30 and 31 published in Gazette 20.

02. 2009 prohibit antedating an appointment. In Abeywikcrema v Pathirana [1986] 1

SLR 120 and Public Service United Services Union v The Minister of Public

Administration [1988] 1 SLR 229, the Supreme Court has observed that the

Establishment Code has statutory force.

While being mindful of these restrictions, I wish to nevertheless emphasize that in

terms of rule 140 of the PSC Procedural Rules, the Supreme Court has the overarching

power to determine the seniority of Public Officers. In the case at hand, the parties

having already arrived at a settlement envisaging antedating, the question is one of

determining whether attaching a notional value to the said settlement would

discriminate the present Petitioners viz a viz their equals.

In the absence of any justification, which is apparent on the facts of this case, I am of

the opinion it would be so.

In those circumstances, I declare that the eligible Petitioners rights have been violated

under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution and make an order that the promotions of the

eligible Petitioners in the document marked C filed by the Respondents by way of

motion dated 17. 03. 2014 be antedated to 25th September 2007 and only allow such

promotees to aggregate the past years to their service.

17

As already reflected in the said motion, such eligible petitioners will not be entitled to

back wages and their seniority will be determined according to the marks they received

at the interview.
