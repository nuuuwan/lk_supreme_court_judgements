Dr. Avanthi Perera SSC, for the Respondents.

Argued on:28.08.2018

Decided on: 12.12.2018

Murdu N.B. Fernando, PC. J,

The Petitioners have filed this application seeking a declaration that the Petitioner’s

Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution have been violated by one

or more or all of the 1st to 12th Respondents and / or by the State.

Leave to proceed was granted on 06-06-2018 for the alleged violation of Article 12 (1) of

the Constitution against the 1st to 12th Respondents.

4

The facts of this case, as submitted by the Petitioners are as follows,

The 2nd Petitioner who is the mother of the 1st Petitioner tendered an application to Royal

College, Colombo 07 for the admission of the 1st Petitioner to Grade one for the year 2018, under

the category “Brothers/Sisters of applicants already studying in the School” based on the relevant

Circular dated 30-05-2017 (P3).

The Petitioners were called for an interview (P4) on 23-08-2017 and were required to

submit documents listed in P4 at the interview, namely proof of residence and proof of brother

studying in School. The Petitioners tendered documents P5a to P5f and P6a to P6c respectively

in support of their application.

At the interview before the Interview Board consisting of 1st to 5th Respondents the

Petitioners were given “0” Zero marks and were informed that the last will submitted to establish

title of the property cannot be accepted. The Petitioners state, even if no marks were given for

proof of title of property, the Petitioners were entitled to at least 48 marks, as the older brother of

the 1st Petitioner is a student of the School from grade 01 grade 10 and for his achievements in

School and also for the parents being registered at the given address in the Electoral Registry

during the last 5 years. Petitioners also state that Clause 7.1.3 of the Circular categorically

provided that refraining from allocating marks under one heading is not a reason to refrain from

allocating marks under the remaining heads.

On 28-09-2017 the 2nd Petitioner lodged a complaint with the Human Rights

Commission. The first day of inquiry was postponed as the 1st Respondent (Chairman of the

Interview Board and Principal, Royal College) was not present. On the next date of inquiry the

1st Respondent was represented and moved time to consider marks and documents pertaining to

brother category but did not tender same to the Human Rights Commission until this application

was filed before this Court on 30-01-2018.

Petitioners further state that subsequently they were made aware that Clause 7.1.3 of the

Circular (P3) referred to above was repealed on 31-07-2017 (P10A) but by letter dated 19-09-

2017 (P10B) the 12th Respondent, Secretary, Ministry of Education had clarified that the repeal

5

of Clause 7.1.3 does not mean that the applicants should be denied marks under the remaining

headings only because a particular applicant is not entitled for marks under one heading.

The 1st Respondent in his affidavit filed before this Court states that an endorsement was

made at the very beginning on the marking sheet (P7) referring to the absence of a requisite

document and in accordance with the relevant Circular as amended, no marks were given to the

1st Petitioner.

1st Respondent further averred that consequent to the processing of the application of the

1st Petitioner, the 12th Respondent’s letter dated 19-09-2017 (P10B) was received clarifying the

implication of repealing Clause 7.1.3 of P3 inter-alia, that where an applicant has basic

qualifications, the repeal did not necessarily mean that the application should be rejected in toto

on the basis that marks cannot be awarded under one part of a particular category. However,

since the Respondent School did not process any applications after 19-09-2017 the clarification

given by the 12th Respondent was not resorted in respect of any application and hence all

application were treated alike without discrimination and therefore the Respondent’s have not

violated the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners.

The Respondents also submitted that, the Constitution guarantees equal protection of the

law and that the Respondents applied the ‘applicable law’ at the relevant time and did not act

contrary to the applicable law, namely the relevant Circular (P3) as amended (P10 A/ 1R1) and

further submitted that acting contrary to the amended Circular and applying the original Circular

would have been a violation of the applicable law.

In responding to the position taken up by the Petitioners, that the clarification given by

the 12th Respondent, Secretary, Ministry of Education should have been taken cognizance at the

time the Petitioners appeal was considered by the Appeal Board, the Respondents submitted that

it would have led to an overhaul of the entire evaluation process in respect of all applicants

whose applications had been rejected on the same premise in order to prevent discrimination.

Petitioner on the other hand submitted that the Respondents have failed to establish that

there were more similarly circumstanced applicants and relied on the maxim vigilantibus et non

dormientibus succurrunt jura, a maxim of Roman Law subsequently embraced by equity, that

6

the law comes to the assistance of those who are vigilant with their rights, and not those who

sleep on their rights which maxim has now been absorbed in to our legal system.

Having referred to the positions taken-up by the Petitioners and the Respondents

respectively in this application, I will now advert to the Circular pertaining to Admission of

Children to Grade One in Government Schools for the year 2018.

A paramount wish of a parent is to admit a child to a School of their choice and the

issuance of the Circular governing Admission to Schools is eagerly awaited, as it lays down the

basic qualifications, categories, procedure and time lines that ought to be followed in order to be

eligible for admission to grade one every year. The Circular (P3) pertaining to admission to

grade one in 2018 was issued on 30-05-2017 and applications had to be submitted by 30-06-2017

to the respective Schools. The basic qualification for admission as stated in Clause 2, is the age

of the child and it is undisputed that the 1st Petitioner passed the 1st hurdle.

The 2nd hurdle to overcome is Clause 4.7 wherein it states that the parents should be

resident in the Administrative District of the School applied for also referred to as the feeder

area. This hurdle too, the parents passed since Kirulapone, Colombo, where the parents reside

comes within the Administrative District of Colombo in which Royal College to which

admission was sought by the Petitioners is situated.

The 3rd hurdle is Clause 3, the category under which an application should be made.

There are six Categories referred to in the Clause under which an application could be made.

They are as follows:-

-Children of residents in close proximity to the School

-Children of parents who are past pupils of the School

-Brothers / Sisters of students already studying in the school

-Children of persons in the staff of institutions directly involved in school

education

-Children of officers on transfer

-Children of persons returned to Sri Lanka after living abroad.

Clause 7.1 discusses the mode and manner of selections based upon the six different

categories referred to above and the percentages upon which the selections will be made.

7

In this case the 2nd Petitioner a resident in the Administrative District of Colombo

submitted an application in respect of the 1st Petitioner under Clause 7.4 “Brother Category” to

the Respondent School, as the older brother of the child was studying in the said School.

According to the provisions of Clause 7.1 the percentage allocated for Brother Category is 15%

of the total number of vacancies for the given year.

The Provisional List and the Final List (P11A and P11B) produced by the Petitioners

before this Court indicate the number of vacancies or the selections made for ‘Brother Category’

for the year 2018, was 40 and the cut-off mark under the Brother Category or the marks obtained

by the 40th child selected under the ‘Brother Category’ was 22.5. Admittedly the 1st Petitioner

was given “0” zero marks or no marks and thus was not admitted to the Respondent School.

In the absence of the 1st Respondent submitting any documentation pertaining to the

number of vacancies and cut-off marks for Brother Category, I rely on the documents submitted

by the Petitioners as P11A and P11B as correct.

Let me now advert to the Marks Sheet (P7) issued to the Petitioners by the Respondent

School. The description column therein is a reproduction of Clause 7.4 albeit brief of Circular

P3. The description as referred to in P7 verbatim is reproduced as follows;

1)Brother in School

2)Registration of Electoral

3)Other documents

4)Proximity

5)Achievements and donations

I observe that the Interview Board, in P7 had not given any marks under any of the items

above and had made an endorsement, under the notes column “No deed. Only the Last Will”.

Further I observe that the Petitioner had tendered documents under items (1), (2) and (5) and for

item (1) Brother in School, 1st Petitioner claims the maximum 25 marks under Clause 7.4.1.1 and

7.4.1.2, for item (2) Registration in the Electoral Register, the maximum 20 marks under Clause

7.4.2.1, and for item (5) 3 marks under Clause 7.4.5 for the achievements of the brother, totalling

48 marks, out of 100 marks.

Thus, the primary question this Court has to answer is whether the decision of the

Interview Board was correct in giving zero marks or no marks to this applicant.

8

In view of the position taken up by the Respondents that marks were not given to the

applicant based on the ‘relevant law’ or the applicable law as at the given date, firstly let me

consider Circular (P3) and the provisions of the said Circular without recourse to the original

Clause 7.1.3.

The 2nd Petitioner made an application to the Respondent School under ‘Brother

Category’ as the older child of the 2nd Petitioner was already studying in the School. Clause 7.4

has five Sub-Clauses and the said five Sub-Clauses are reflected in the marking sheet (P7)

referred to earlier and are now discussed in detail.

i.Brother in School

Under Sub-Clause 7.4.1.1, 20 marks are allocated for the years of study of the older

brother in School (2 marks for each grade) and under Sub-Clause 7.4.1.2, an additional 5 marks

are given for the older brother if he was admitted to grade one of the School.

Thus, the 1st Petitioner is entitled for the maximum 20 marks (2 marks for each

grade to a maximum of 20 marks) as the older brother presently is a student in grade ten, plus

another 5 marks as the older brother was admitted to grade one of the School. This would entitle

the 1st Petitioner for 25 marks under this description.

(ii) Electoral Register as proof of residency

Sub-Clause 7.4.2 refers to registration in the Electoral Register and the 2nd Petitioner has

submitted extracts of the Electoral Register for the last 5 years as proof of being registered at the

given address.

Thus, the 1st Petitioner is entitled for 20 marks, the maximum marks under this Sub-

Clause.

(iii)Title of property as proof of residency

Sub-Clause 7.4.3 indicates the documents to establish title to the residence. The 2nd

Petitioner relied on the last will given by her spouse’s father (Child’s grandfather) to the spouse

(Child’s father) to establish the title of the residence. No marks could be given for same as the

last will being an entitlement of title to a property is not acceptable as it does not come within the

documents indicated in this Sub-Clause.

9

(iv) Proximity to School

Sub-clause 7.4.4 refers to the Proximity of the School to the place of residence. Marks

will only be given under this item, if title of the residence is established and no marks can be

given to the 1st Petitioner under this item, as title of the residence was not established.

(v) Achievements and donations.

Sub-Clause 7.4.5 refers to a maximum of 10 marks for achievements and contributions

made to the School by the older brother. The certificates tendered (P6A to P6C) by the 2nd

Petitioner especially the older brother being a junior prefect, should entitle the 1st Petitioner at

least 2-3 marks, under this Sub-Clause.

Thus, I observe that out of the 5 items in Sub-Clause 7.4, excepting 7.4.4 where marks

can be given only if 7.4.3 is fulfilled, all the other 4 Sub-Clauses are stand alone Sub-Clauses,

independent to each other. One Sub-Clause does not get priority over the other Sub-Clause and

there is no justification not to give marks for items (1) and (2) merely because items (3) or (4)

are not full filled. On the corollary, in the Brother Category just because an applicant is not

entitled to any marks under item (5) achievements and donations, should an applicant not be

given marks under item (1) brother in School. I consider such argument to be ludicrous.

The only explanation given by the Respondent School for non-granting of marks under

item (1), (2) and (5) of the Brother Category, is that the applicant could not prove to the

satisfaction of the Interview Board, the Petitioner’s place of residence. The Sub-Clause does not

give item (3) priority over item (1) or (2) or (5) i.e. Priority for title of residence over older

brother studying in School or Electoral Register or achievements of the brother. All descriptions

or items are of equal footing. Thus, Clause 7.1.3 earlier adverted to, is repealed or not is

immaterial. The plain reading of Clause 7.4, older brother studying in school is that, if there is an

older brother studying in School, a parent can apply under this category and is entitled to the

marks reflected therein irrespective of whether he has proved title of residence or not. What is

material is to be a resident in the feeder area namely the Administrative District of Colombo

which factor was established by the Petitioner by submitting the extracts of the Electoral

Register.

10

The Respondents have tendered the site reports said to have been done after this

application was filed in the Supreme Court in the months of April and May 2018, to indicate that

the Petitioners are not resident at the given address but only the parents of the 2nd Petitioner are

resident at the given address. I place no reliance on these one paragraph site reports, since at the

time the decision was made to grant zero marks, these reports were not available with the

Respondent School. In any event, the Petitioners have submitted an affidavit of the grand mother

of the child to counter the facts stated in the site reports with the counter affidavit and the said

reports are disputed.

Thus, on a careful consideration of Clause 7.4 of the Circular, I accept the Petitioners

position that a minimum of 45 marks should have been given to the 1st Petitioner under Sub

Clause 7.4.1 and 7.4.2 of the Circular which brings him within the cut-off mark of 22.5 for the

Brother Category and would place him among the top half or among the 1st twenty places out of

the forty places available for Brother Category as evidenced by the Final List (P11B). Petitioners

are also entitled for more marks under Sub-Clause 7.4.5 for achievements of the older brother as

adverted to earlier.

In Gayani Geethika Vs Dissanayake SC (FR) 35/2011- S.C.M. 12.07.2011 a case

pertaining to School Admissions under proximity Category, Suresh Chandra J with Marsoof J

and Ekanayake J agreeing held that the cumulative effect of all documents submitted along with

the grade one school admission application should be considered and assessed carefully in order

to establish the genuiness of the residence of an applicant.

Similarly, in another school admission case under proximity category Pushparajan

Rohan Vs Kariyawasam SC (FR) 06/2017 - S.C.M. 03.11.2017 Malalgoda J with

Wanasundera J and Perera J agreeing held that it was arbitrary for the School not to grant any

marks, merely because one of the documents listed to verify proof of residency had not been

submitted.

The Judgements referred to above are in respect of applications under category (1),

Children of residents in close proximity, where proximity is the key factor.

In the matter now before this Court, the application was made under category (3) namely,

Brother Category, where the older brother studying in school is the key factor. None of the

11

documents tendered as proof of the older brother studying in school by the Petitioners had been

considered by the Interview Board. These include older brothers School Record Book, Junior

Prefect Certificate, Boys Scouts Patrol Leader Certificate, Grade V Government Schools

Scholarship Exam Merit Certificate and many other Certificates. The failure of the interview

board to consider and assess these documents and Certificates and award marks, I consider

caused grave injustice to the younger brother, the 1st Petitioner in this application.

At this juncture, I wish to consider Clause 3 of the Circular once again. It refers to six

categories, namely;

-Children of residents in close proximity to the School

-Children of parents who are past pupils of the School

-Brothers / Sisters of students already studying in the school

-Children of persons in the staff of institutions directly involved in school

education

-Children of officers on transfer

-Children of persons returned to Sri Lanka after living abroad.

When an applicant has fulfilled the basic qualification for admission namely the

minimum age and resident in the feeder area or the Administrative District in which the School is

situated (excepting for past pupil category) such an applicant can submit an application under

any one or more of the above referred categories. The key factor to be established is proximity,

sibling studying in School, parents involved in School Education, Public Officers on transfer and

Children returned from abroad.

The Admission Circular has been in existence for the last two decades and the 12th

Respondent and his predecessors would have had good reasons to categories applications under

Clause 3 of the Circular in this manner. The object of separate categorization of applicants would

be rendered nugatory, if the key factor is over looked and an additional threshold criteria is

applied by schools in admitting children under this Circular creating another hurdle on the

parent, not envisaged by the Circular and there by violating the Circular itself.

This Court is very much aware that there is fierce competition within the Categories

itself, to be successful to gain a slot for the limited number of vacancies under the particular

category. Thus in the absence of an elimination process as envisaged in Sub Clause 7.4.4 (where

12

it is clearly laid down that no marks will be given, if Sub-Clause 7.4.3 is not fulfilled) marks

should be allocated under each and every Sub-Clause of the particular category and selections

made based on the total marks to achieve the objects of the Circular. Sub-Clause 7.1.3, heavily

relied upon in these proceedings only re-iterates the above proposition. The repeal of the Sub-

Clause does not envisage that a threshold criteria should be applied violating the provisions of

the Circular.

Let me now advert to the letter of clarification issued by the 12th Respondent, Secretary,

Ministry of Education (P10B) dated 19-09-2017. This letter specifically refers to the effect of the

repeal of Sub Clause 7.1.3 and clarifies that the basic qualification is residence within the feeder

area and proof of residency is only one criteria.

The Respondents submitted to this Court that the application of the interpretation set out

in Secretary, Ministry of Education letter did not arise since no grade one applications were

processed after receipt of this letter and the School treated all applications alike and did not

award marks for the remaining parts of a category when an applicant has not secured marked

under one category. In the absence of any documentation to substantiate that no processing of

applications took place after 19-09-2017, as averred to by the 1st Respondent and since the

Provisional List was published only on 16-11-2017 two months after the issuance of P10B and 3

months after the Petitioners faced the interview and the Appeal Board should have met

consequent to the publication of the Provisional List and especially since the Appeal Board

proceedings and determinations are not before Court, I cannot accept the reasons given by the

Respondents in not re-evaluating the applications in the best interests of the child as

contemplated by the letter of the Secretary, Ministry of Education, who is the 12th Respondent

before this Court. Furthermore this clarification/interpretation comes from the author of Circular

P3 who by virtue of Clause 12.10 is the Authority to monitor and supervise admission of

students to grade one of all Government Schools.

I also cannot accept the position taken by the Respondents, that the Respondents in all

instances where an applicant to the Respondent School had not secured marks under part of

category such applicants were treated alike and marks were not awarded for the remaining parts

of that category and therefore all similarly circumstanced persons were treated equally, as no

material, documents or statistics are before this Court, to substantiate that position at least in

13

respect of the Brother Category under which the Petitioners tendered an application to admit the

1st Petitioner to the Respondent School.

I also observe that the Provisional List varies from the Final List (P11A and P11B) and

there is no explanation for same before this Court.

The Respondents submission that acting contrary to the amended Circular and applying

the original Circular would violate the applicable law too cannot be accepted for the reasons

adverted to earlier.

In the above circumstance, I hold that the Petitioners have established that the 1st to 10th

Respondents have violated the 1st and 2nd Petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed under

Article 12(1) of the Constitution by granting zero marks or no marks at the interview to the 1st

Petitioner and thus refusing 1st Petitioner admission to Grade One of Royal College, Colombo 07

in the year 2018.

Therefore, the Respondents are directed to take steps forthwith to admit the 1st Petitioner

to Grade One or to the appropriate Grade of Royal College, Colombo 07.
