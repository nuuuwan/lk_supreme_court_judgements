Exemplary damages may be awarded where, inter alia, the infringer had made a calculated infringement with the knowledge that his profit would be more than the compensation he would be required to pay. However, in Kuddus v Chief Constable of Leicestershire [2002] 2 AC 122, it was held that exemplary damages could only be granted in limited circumstances.",
