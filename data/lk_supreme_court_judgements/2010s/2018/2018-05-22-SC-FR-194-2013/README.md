Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

Petitioner to the present application namely Pankumburage Rohitha Anura Kumara of

Malmeekanda, Opanayaka had come before this court alleging that his fundamental rights

guaranteed under Articles 12 (1), 13 (2), 13 (5) and 14 (1) (h) of the Constitution had been violated

by the 1st to the 7th Respondents. When this matter was supported before the Supreme Court for

leave to proceed on 27/07/2013, this court after considering the submissions, had made the

following order;

Having heard submissions of counsel this court grants leave for an alleged violation in

terms of Articles 12 (1), 13 (1) and 13 (2)

3

The Petitioner has indicated to the state that some of the Respondents have not involved

in this incident and that she would be satisfied if relief is granted against the 2nd

Respondent

In the said circumstances the State Counsel continued to appear only for the Attorney General and

the 2nd Respondent against whom leave to proceed was granted and relief was claimed, was

represented by his counsel.

The Petitioner was a Junior Health Assistant at National Cancer Institute, Maharagama since 2006.

On 16th March 2013 the Petitioner had quit his job without informing the authorities and left for

his village in Opanayaka since he could not face some of his friends from whom he had borrowed

monies. In the meantime the Petitioner was served with a letter of interdiction dated 18.04.2013

by Director, National Cancer Institute, Maharagama.

Somewhere around 23rd March 2013 the Petitioner had got to know by news, that one Medical

Laboratory Technician of National Cancer Institute, Maharagama named Thilaka Nandani

Jayasinghe had been murdered on 22.03.2013.

When the Petitioner was at home, on 4th May 2013 around 2.30 p.m. the 2nd and the 5th

Respondents whom they identified as officers attached to Boralesgamuwa Police Station, had

visited his house and had taken him to Opanayaka Police Station in order to question him in

connection with the death of the said Thilaka Nandani Jayasinghe.

The two officers were clad in civil and had come to the Petitioners house in a three-wheeler.

Petitioner had gone along with the two officers to Opanayaka Police Station, and waited for nearly

one hour at the said Police Station to meet the Office-in-Charge (4th Respondent) since he was

busy with some meetings. Finally the 2nd Respondent who met the 4th Respondent without the

Petitioner, had informed him that he will have to take him to Boralesgamuwa Police Station to

record his statement. According to the Petitioner, he was never arrested by the 2nd or the 5th

Respondent at any stage, but he was made aware by them that he will be taken to

Boralesgamuwa Police Station in order to record a statement with regard to the death of Thilaka

Nandani Jayasinghe.

4 Since 4th night the Petitioner was at Boralesgamuwa Police Station and on the 5th, after he was

questioned by the 1st Respondent the Office-in-Charge, had put him in to the cell around 3.00 a.m.

Two friends of the Petitioner, who visited the Police Station on 6th and 7th May, had signed a bail

bond at the Police Station on 7th and the Petitioner too had signed a book on the same day but

was never released on bail.

Out of the two friends who visited the Petitioner at Boralesgamuwa Police Station one Dushan

Ajith Nilanga had submitted an affidavit confirming the above position and had stated that,

a) He, along with one Sudeera Udeshika Jayalath Premarathne, had visited the Petitioner at

Boralesgamuwa Police Station on 7th around 9.30 a.m.

b) When they met the 2nd Respondent, he informed them that he can release the Petitioner

on a bail bond.

c) The said Sudeera Udeshika Jayalath Premarathne stood as the surety and signed a register

along with Rohitha (the Petitioner) before a police officer unknown to them.

d) Even after signing the bail bond the Petitioner was never released and all attempts to meet

the 2nd Respondent failed thereafter.

As further submitted on behalf of Petitioner, he was finally produced before the Magistrates

Court of Nugegoda on the 10th May under the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance for

allegedly committing an offence under the said Act and he had been taken back to the Police

Station to be detained for a further period of 7 days, under the provisions of the said Act. The

Petitioner was finally granted bail by the Magistrate Nugegoda on 16.05.2013, when the police

filed plaint under section 78 of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. According to

the charge sheet which is produced marked P-1 it was alleged that the Petitioner was in

possession of 40 mg of heroin on or about 09.05.2013.

However, as submitted by the Petitioner he was never apprehended by police on 09.05.2013 with

a quantity of heroin as alleged in P-1, but he was kept at Boralesgamuwa Police Station from 4th

night until he was produced before the Magistrates Court of Nugegoda on 10th May 2013.

In the said circumstances the Petitioner had alleged that;

5

a) The 2nd Respondent had failed to explain the reasons for his arrest on 04.05.2013 when he

was first taken to Opanayaka Police Station

b) He was unlawfully detained at the Boralesgamuwa Police Station for more than 5 days

c) He was not enlarged on police bail even though a bail bond was signed at the Police Station

on 07.05.2013

d) He was never arrested by the officers attached to the Boralesgamuwa Police Station with a

quantity of heroin on 09.05.2013 as alleged in the charge sheet produced marked P-1

e) The officers of the Boralesgamuwa Police Station had misled the Hon. Magistrate,

Nugegoda when they reported the above facts before the Magistrate on 09.05.2013 and

obtain an order to detain the suspect for a further period of 7 days under the provisions of

the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

In addition to the above position taken up by the Petitioner, it was further submitted during the

argument before this court that, the learned Magistrate Nugegoda had discharged the Petitioner

from the case filed against him by the Boralesgamuwa Police referred to above, since the only

witness to the said case, the 2nd Respondent failed to appear before the Magistrates Court on

several trial dates.

Having considered the material placed before this court on behalf of the Petitioner, as referred to

above I will now proceed to consider the position taken up by the Respondents before this court.

As observed above, it was submitted on behalf of the Petitioner that the Petitioner was satisfied if

relief is granted only against the 2nd Respondent. The learned Senior State Counsel who

represented the Attorney General (8th Respondent) brought this to the notice of this court and

submitted that, in the said circumstances no objections were tendered on behalf of the other

Respondents. The 2nd Respondent who was represented by his own counsel had tendered

objections on behalf of him.

In the said objection tendered before this court the 2nd Respondent had taken up the position

that;

a) He was attached to the Boralesgamuwa Police Station as Officer-in-Charge of the crimes

branch as at 23.03.2013

6

b) Medical Laboratory Technician of the National Cancer Institute, Maharagama named

Thilaka Nandani Jayasinghe had been murdered on 23.03.2013

c) He being the Officer-in-Charge of crimes branch was assisting the investigations into the

said offence

d) He received reliable information, that the petitioner and the deceased had close

relationship and during the relevant period, the petitioner had not reported to duty and

had left the Cancer Hospital.

e) On inquiries made, he received information that the petitioner is a resident from

Opanayaka, and had left to Opanayaka with PC 79603 on 05.05.2013 in order to arrest the

petitioner with the permission he obtained from the Senior Superintendent of Police of his

Division

f) He visited the house of the petitioner at Malmeekanda, Opanayaka and questioned him

with regard to his involvement with the deceased. Since he could not satisfy with the

explanation provided by the petitioner, the petitioner was arrested at the said address at

19.30 hours, after explaining the reasons for his arrest i.e. that he was suspected for the

death of Thilaka Nandani Jayasinghe

g) He informed the said arrest to the Officer-in-Charge of the Opanayaka Police Station and

thereafter proceeded to Police Station Boralesgamuwa.

h) After his return on the 6th morning he produced the petitioner at the reserve after

informing the Officer-in-Charge of his Police Station and the Senior Superintendent of

Police of the area

i) When a suspect is brought to the Police Station, all the responsibilities with regard to

release on bail, producing before court, detaining in the police custody and conducting

inquiry, is vested with the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station and therefore the 2nd

Respondent has no responsibility on those matters, but he was aware of the fact that the

petitioner was released on bail

j) He re-arrested the petitioner on 09.05.2013 at Katuwawala on some information and at

the time of his arrest the petitioner was in possession of one packet of heroin. This arrest

was made around 18.15 hours. After his arrest he was once again produced at the reserve

along with the production taken into custody.

7 When going through the objections tendered on behalf of the 2nd Respondent I observed that

there exists a major discrepancy with regard to the date of arrest of the Petitioner. According to

the Petitioner, the so called arrest took place on 4th May but the notes tendered on behalf of the

2nd Respondent including out and in entry of the 2nd Respondent indicate that the arrest took

place on 5th May 2013 at 19.30 hours and was produced at Boralesgamuwa Police Station at 08.30

hours on 6th May 2013.

The only way the accuracy of the above notes can be tested, is by comparing them with the other

notes made at Boralesgamuwa Police Station and/or Opanayake Police Station, but with the own

application made on behalf of the Petitioner, this court is deprived of ascertaining the correctness

of the positions taken up by both parties before this court. In this regard I am mindful of the

submissions made by the learned Senior State Counsel and therefore this court is unable to make

any conclusions with regard to the date of arrest of the Petitioner.

As observed by this court, the Petitioners complaint before this court can be summarized as

follows;

a) That he was not explained the reasons for his arrest on 04.05.2013

b) That he was detained illegally at Boralesgamuwa Police Station until he was enlarged on

bail by the Magistrate, Nugegoda on 16.05.2013

c) That he was never arrested on 09.05.2013 with a quantity of heroin by the officers

attached to Boralesgamuwa Police station at Katuwawala

However the Petitioner has admitted in his pleadings that the 2nd Respondent had made him to

understand that the Petitioner was taken from his house at Malmeekanda to Opanayaka Police

Station at the very first instance and thereafter from Opanayaka Police Station to Boralesgamuwa

Police Station for the purpose of recording a statement with regard to the murder of Thilaka

Nandani Jayasinghe. It was further revealed that both the said Thilaka Nandani Jayasinghe and the

Petitioner were attached to National Cancer Institute, Maharagama and the Petitioner had kept

away from his work place during the time the said murder had taken place and in the said

circumstances it is clear that the investigators who investigated into the death of the said

deceased, had reasons to suspect the Petitioners involvement. In this regard the 2nd Respondent

8 had produced his out entry and therefore it is evident from the material before this court that the

2nd Respondent along with PC 79603 had gone to Opanayaka looking for the Petitioner.

The 2nd Respondent further admits meeting the Petitioner and questioning him with regard to the

death of the deceased Thilaka Nandani Jayasinghe, but he was not satisfied with the answers he

received from the Petitioner and therefore decided to arrest him and explained the said reasons

for the arrest to him.

When considering all the circumstance referred to above, I see no reason to disbelieve the 2nd

Respondent on the question of arrest, since there is adequate material placed before this court by

the 2nd Respondent that there was a reason for the arrest of the Petitioner and in fact the 2nd

Respondent had left for Malmeekanda, Opanayaka along with PC 79603 with the permission of

the Senior Superintendent of Police of the area for that purpose.

The next issue before this court is to consider the questions of illegal detention of the Petitioner

by the 2nd Respondent. As alleged by the Petitioner he was detained at Boralesgamuwa Police

Station initially until 10th May without any court order and subsequently till the 16th on a court

order obtained by submitting incorrect information. Petitioner admits the 1st Respondent the

Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station questioning him during this period and obtaining his

signature to some forms and his friend signing a bail bond.

As revealed during the argument before this court, investigation, detention and release of a

suspect who was produced before a Police Station, is the function of the Officer-in-Charge of the

said Police Station and not with the other officers. The Petitioner had further submitted that the

2nd Respondent spoke to his friend when he came to the Police Station prior to signing the bail

bond. The affidavit submitted by Dushan Ajith Nilanga confirms the fact that the Petitioner was

kept in custody, even though a bail bond was signed on behalf of the Petitioner by Sudeera

Udeshika Jayalath Premarathne on 7th May 2013. According to Nilanga all efforts to meet the 2nd

Respondent thereafter failed until the Petitioner was produced before court. The 2nd Respondent

in his objection admits his knowledge with regard to releasing the Petitioner on bail, but had taken

up the position that he has nothing to do with the detention and/or release of the Petitioner. He

only submits documentary proof of the re-arrest of the Petitioner.

9 Due to the own decision of the Petitioner not to proceed against any other Respondents, this

court is deprived of the most important material which needs to consider,

a) Whether the Petitioner was detained illegally at Boralesgamuwa Police Station from

05.05.2013 to 16.05.2013

b) Whether the Petitioner was in fact enlarged on bail prior to his arrest on 09.05.2013.

The 2nd Respondent, who admits the re-arrest of the Petitioner on 09.05.2013, had submitted his

notes of arrest and the notes pertaining to the production of the suspect and the productions at

the reserve but has failed to submit any document with regard to the release of the suspect prior

to 09.05.2013.

During the argument before this court, our attention was drawn to the fact that the so called

initial arrest was with regard to an ongoing investigation in to an unsolved murder, and in the said

circumstances it was unlikely that a person who was suspected of that offence could enlarge on

police bail during the investigation and therefore the court should reject the fact when it was

submitted that the Petitioner was re-arrested by the 2nd Respondent on 09.05.2013 with a

quantity of heroin. The above position taken up by the Petitioner is further strengthen from the

fact that the Petitioner was subsequently discharged from the Magistrates Court proceedings

filed against him for possessions of 40 mg of heroin for non-prosecution of the case due to the

repeated absence of the material witness namely the 2nd Respondent.

As observed earlier I am not inclined to conclude that the initial arrest of the Petitioner by the 2nd

Respondent is illegal but, the legality of the subsequent detention after he was produced at the

Boralesgamuwa Police Station on 06.05.2013 at 08.30 hours as documented before this court is in

doubt.

In this regard the 2nd Respondent had failed to submit any material to establish that the Petitioner

was enlarged on police bail prior to 09.05.2013. As this court has already observed, the material

the 2nd Respondent had furnished with regard to the re-arrest on 09.05.2013 is doubtful and I am

not inclined to act upon the notes tendered on behalf of the 2nd Respondent with regard to the

above arrest.

10 Due to the own decision of the Petitioner not to proceed against the Respondents other than the

2nd Respondent, some of the important material with regard to the detention of the Petitioner and

those who were Responsible for violations of the Petitioners fundamental rights are not before

this court.

However as concluded in the case of Sri Thaminda, Dharshane and Mahalekam V. Inspector

General of Police 2007 ii SLR at 294 by Saleem Marsoof J that,

Despite the failure on the part of the Petitioner to identify those who violate the

fundamental rights, they are entitled to a declaration that their fundamental rights have

been violated by executive and administrative action.

Even though 2nd Respondent had taken up the position that, he being the officer in charge of the

crimes division, he is not responsible for the investigation, detentions, discharge and/or enlarging

bail, his subsequent conduct, clearly revealed his involvement with regard to the detention of the

Petitioner.

In the said circumstances I declare that the fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed under

Articles 12 (1), and 13 (2) of the Constitution had been violated by the 2nd Respondent and several

other Respondents who were not identified in these proceedings.

I further make order directing the 2nd Respondent to pay Rs. 50,000/- and state to pay

Rs. 100,000/- as compensation to the Petitioner. The state is further directed to pay Rs. 50,000/-

as cost for this case.
