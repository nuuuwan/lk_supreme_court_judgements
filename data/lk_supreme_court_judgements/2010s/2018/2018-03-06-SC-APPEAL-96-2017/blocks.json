The Plaintiff had made an Application under Sec. 87(3) of the CPC , to purge his default in appearance, but at the said inquiry also the ADJ had dismissed the said Application on 29.07.2011. Thereafter, being aggrieved by the said order dated 29.07.2011 of the ADJ who dismissed the application on purging the default inquiry, the Plaintiff then preferred a Final Appeal to the Civil Appellate High Court by a Petition of Appeal dated 30.08.2011. Both parties were represented before the Civil Appellate High Court. It is on the notice sent by the Plaintiff Zurfick to the Defendant Naufer by registered post, that the Defendant was represented in the High Court by counsel, although the notice was not served on the registered attorney of the Defendant. However, thereafter, in the Civil Appellate High Court, after 5 years from the date of the Petition of Appeal having been filed, the counsel for the Defendant Naufer who was the Respondent in the said Appeal, by way of a motion dated 26.08.2016, moved court to consider a dismissal of the Appeal on the ground of \u201cnot duly complying with the mandatory provisions of Sec.755(2)(b) of the Civil Procedure Code\u201d. It was considered as a preliminary objection. The parties had to file written submissions on this preliminary objection. The Civil Appellate High Court by its order dated 09.11.2016 overruled the preliminary objection and had set down the Appeal before the High Court for hearing on merits. Then the Defendant Respondent Respondent Appellant has come before this Court in Appeal from that order and this Court has granted leave to appeal on the aforementioned questions of law. The position taken up by the Appellant is that , a copy of the Notice of Appeal regarding the case before the Civil Appellant High Court , was not served on the Registered Attorney of Naufer who was the Defendant Respondent Respondent in that case, as required by Section 755(2)(b) of the Civil Procedure Code and that it is a mandatory provision.",

    "text": "not satisfied that the notice of appeal was duly served upon him or his registered attorney. By Section 770, the appellate court is empowered to issue the requisite notice of appeal for service. I find that, all the provisions with regard to appeals stand for \u2018hearing of the appeals of the aggrieved parties on the merits\u2019 and \u2018not to throw away the appeals without hearing them on merits\u2019. That is the very reason for having placed Section 770 in the Civil Procedure Code, paving the way for the Appellate Judge or Judges to take over the task of issuing the requisite notice or notices for service on the respondent or respondents in the Appeal which is set down for the Appellate Court to hear and determine. The legislature has stressed on the fact that the respondent should be noticed. Sec. 755(2)(b) specifically provides for the Appellant to serve notice on the Respondent or his Registered Attorney. It is an accepted fact in the case in hand that the notice of appeal was served on Naufer, the Respondent in that case, at his home address and at the Bogambara Prison where he was personally present at the time of the Appeal being filed. The registered article receipts have been filed and accepted in the pleadings by the Respondent and having received the said Notice of Appeal, the said Respondent Naufer had got himself represented in that case before court with an Attorney at Law , having filed proxy on his behalf and having a counsel being retained on his behalf. The preliminary objection against the appeal being heard by court was the mere allegation that having failed to send the notice to the registered attorney , the appeal should be dismissed. When the wording of the Section is clear and notice has been sent to the Respondent, how could he allege non - compliance of the provision and seek a dismissal of the Appeal? There is no prejudice caused to the Respondent at all. The Respondent was served with notice and he was represented before court by his lawyers. Strict compliance of Sec.755(2)(b) has taken place. In the case of Jayasekera Vs Lakmini 2000 1 SLR 41, the ratio decidendi can be drawn to the effect that ;",

The power of the court to grant relief under Section 759(2) is wide and discretionary and is subject to such terms as the court may deem just. Relief may be granted even if no excuse for non - compliance is forthcoming. iii. Relief cannot be granted if the court is of the opinion that the respondent has been materially prejudiced in which event the appeal has to be dismissed. In the case of Heenmenike Vs Mangala Malkanthi , Bar Association Law Journal 2016 Vol XXII pg. 110, it was held that the failure to comply with Section 755(1) by not citing the 2nd substituted plaintiff as a respondent in the notice of appeal and in the petition of appeal is a curable defect under Section 759(2) and Section 770 of the Civil Procedure Code. In the case of Wilson Vs Kusumawathie 2015 BLR 49, it was held that it is undoubtedly incumbent upon the court to utilize the statutory provisions and grant the relief embodied therein if it appears to court that it is just and fair to do so. In the case of Francis and another Vs. Premawathy 2005 3 SLR 87 , it was held that Sec.755(2)(b) lays down that the notice of appeal shall be accompanied by proof of service, on the respondent, or on his registered attorney, of a copy of the notice of appeal, in the form of a written acknowledgment of the receipt of such notice or the registered postal receipt in proof of such service. In the case in hand the notice of appeal was sent to the respondent by registered post to his house and the prisons and the registered article receipts were produced as evidence and as a result the respondent was represented in court by lawyers. I find that no prejudice has been caused to the Defendant Respondent. The counsel for the Appellant in the case in hand complained that the Civil Appellate High Court has not considered the case of Sumanasekera Vs Yapa",

The District Court had given judgment in favour of the Plaintiff. The Defendant had filed notice of appeal and the petition of appeal within time. The Plaintiff Respondent before the Court of Appeal took up a preliminary objection before the District Court that the notice of appeal had been given to the Counsel of the Plaintiff Respondent and not to the Registered Attorney. The District Judge upheld the objection. On leave being granted, it was held by the Court of Appeal, that; (i) The authorities make it mandatory that the notice of appeal and petition of appeal have to be signed by the Registered Attorney and (ii) The Petitioner has not shown any good and sufficient ground for not complying with Section 755(2)(b) and as the Respondent has been materially prejudiced by such non-compliance, the Petitioner is not entitled to relief under Section 759. I find that this case is with regard to the notice being served on the Counsel without sending the same to the Registered Attorney. It is not a case where the notice was sent to the Respondent without sending the same to the Registered Attorney. The Civil Appellate High Court in the case in hand must have considered the decision in Sumanasekera Vs Yapa and concluded that the ratio in that case does not apply to the case in hand. In the case in hand the notice had been sent to the Respondent; he had received it; he had come before court and participated in the case and it is with a motion that he had taken up the position that the notice should have been sent to the Registered Attorney after many years. But it is clear in the wording of the Section 755(2)(b) that the notice has to be sent to the Respondent or the Registered Attorney on record for the Respondent. In the case of Mahatun Mudalali alias Paranatota Vs Napasingho and another 1986 3 CALR 318, which again is a Court of Appeal decision, a document purporting to be a notice of appeal was tendered by the Petitioner",

    "text": "to the court of first instance within the time stipulated by Sec. 754(4) of the Civil Procedure Code. The Petition of Appeal was filed within 60 days. Petitioner failed to deposit security for the Respondents costs within 14 days. Upon objection being taken, in that regard, the District Judge refused the purported notice of appeal. The Petitioner sought leave to appeal from that order. It was held that the effect of the notice of appeal is to inform the respondent that the jurisdiction of the lower court will be suspended, once the appeal is taken and also to deprive the respondent temporarily of the fruits of his victory. By notice is meant actual notice and not some constructive notice. Mere compliance with section 755(1) may at most constitute constructive notice. Actual notice means compliance with Section 755(1) , (2) and Section 754(4) regarding the time within which the notice must be presented and also Section 755(1) and (5) . These requirements are mandatory to constitute a proper notice of appeal. If these conditions are not fulfilled, the court has the power to refuse to receive the notice of appeal. I do not find that in the case in hand the Plaintiff Petitioner has defaulted in complying with any of the sections as mentioned in the reported case of Mahatun Mudalali alias Paranatota Vs Naposingho and another (supra). This case must have been considered by the appellate court even though the Appellant complains that it has not been considered. I find that the Civil Appellate High Court has considered the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code quite correctly and in addition considered the authorities on the pertinent sections and overruled the preliminary objection \u201cthat there was no proper notice because the \u2018notice of appeal has not been served on the registered attorney\u2019 of the respondent.\u201d I hold that the Plaintiff Petitioner Appellant Respondent has complied with Section 755(2)(b) of the Civil Procedure Code. The order of the Civil Appellate High Court is a well considered order and I affirm the same.",
