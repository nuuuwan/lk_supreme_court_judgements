In paragraph [19] of his affidavit, the 1st added Respondent states that accepting the interpretation given by the Petitioner to the Articles of the Constitution which deal with the power of the President to dissolve Parliament would require this Court to \u201ccompletely ignore several established Rules of Interpretation of Statutes and that to do so would be contrary to the Law and the Constitution which Your Lordships are also called upon to respect and uphold, in order to protect, vindicate and enforce the right of the people.\u201d.

    "text": "Ratwatte PC, Mr. V.K. Choksy and Mr. Chrishmal Warnasuriya, have also filed written submissions. I have endeavoured to carefully consider both oral and written submissions made by all counsel when examining the issues before us. Having set out the cases of the parties before us in some detail, I proceed to consider and determine the issues before us in these applications. Jurisdiction When, on 12th and 13th November 2018, the Petitioner\u2018s application in the present case [i.e: SC FR 351/2018] and the other eight applications were supported by counsel for the Petitioners and were opposed by the Attorney General and counsel for the five added Respondents in the course of submissions spanning two days, neither the Attorney General nor counsel for the added Respondents disputed the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to hear and determine any of the issues that arise in these applications challenging the validity of the Proclamation marked \u2015P1\u2016. However, when Mr. Udaya Ranjith Seneviratne, in his capacity as the Secretary to His Excellency, the President filed his affidavit dated 19th November 2018 he has pleaded that this Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine these applications but did not explain the basis on which he makes that claim. The 2nd added Respondent has also pleaded in his affidavit dated 19th November 2018 that the Proclamation marked \u2015P1\u2016 is not subject to judicial review and, in this connection, has stated that the basis on which His Excellency, the President formed his opinion that Parliament should be dissolved is a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d which this Court has no jurisdiction to inquire into. Further, the 2nd added Respondent has stated that the Petitioner cannot invoke the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court since the Petitioner, as a Member of Parliament, had the specific remedy provided by Article 38 (2) (a) (i) of the Constitution of giving the Hon. Speaker notice of resolution moving for the removal of His Excellency, the President from office under the provisions of Article 38 (2) (a) (i) of the Constitution. It is to be noted that none of the other added Respondents \u2013 i.e: the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents - have, in their affidavits, disputed the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to hear and determine these applications. In fact, in their affidavits the 1st and 5th Respondents expressly state that the power vested in the President by Article 33 (2) (c) of the Constitution is \u201csubject to Article 35\u201d of the Constitution while the 3rd and 4th added",

Attorney General submits that the procedure referred to in Article 38 (2) for the Supreme Court constitutes a \u201cspecific mode\u201d prescribed by the Constitution for the Supreme Court to exercise jurisdiction in respect of the Petitioners\u2018 complaints that His Excellency, the President has intentionally violated the Constitution and/or is guilty of the abuse of the powers of his office. It has been submitted that, therefore, the Supreme Court cannot disregard this \u201cspecific provision\u201d referred to in Article 38 (2) and exercise its jurisdiction for the protection of fundamental rights under Article 118 (b) of the Constitution in the Petitioners\u2018 applications. This submission fails on several counts. Firstly, the submission is logically flawed in the case of these particular applications. To put in another way, the submission is a glaring non sequitur in the specific circumstances of these applications. The simple reason for that observation is that these applications challenge a dissolution of Parliament and a Member of a Parliament which is dissolved by the President without notice and literally overnight, cannot have recourse to Article 38 (2) because, at the time the applications are filed, no Parliament would exist in which a motion for impeachment can be brought. Secondly, Article 38 (2) of the Constitution need even be considered only where proceedings for the impeachment of His Excellency, the President have commenced and the Hon. Speaker has referred a resolution to the Supreme Court for inquiry and report or, at the least, when such proceedings are impending. However, no such circumstances have arisen. In fact, there is absolutely no suggestion before us that the Petitioner [or any of the Petitioners in the other applications] has any intention of giving notice of a resolution under Article 38 (2) for the impeachment of His Excellency, the President. The complaint in these applications that the impugned act of His Excellency, the President has allegedly violated the Constitution and/or abused the powers of his office and, thereby, violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioners does not mean that the Petitioner [or any of the other Petitioners] intends to take the extreme step of attempting to impeach His Excellency, the President. Thus, the submission made on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General is founded on hypothesis and is without factual basis or merit. Thirdly, the inalienable right of every citizen of our country to invoke the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is a cornerstone of the sovereignty of the people which is the Grundnorm of our Constitution. Thus, Article 4 (d) declares \u201cthe fundamental rights which are by the Constitution declared and recognized shall be",

Thus, the limited fact-finding role of the Supreme Court under Article 38 (2) cannot be equated with the exercise of judicial power by the Supreme Court in the protection of fundamental rights. In any event, the hypothetical possibility that the Supreme Court may be called upon to perform a limited fact-finding role if a motion under Article 38 (2) is referred to the Supreme Court by the Hon. Speaker cannot, by any stretch of imagination, deprive the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction under Article 118 (b) read with Article 126 for the protection of fundamental rights in the \u2015here and now\u2016. Fifthly, it is patently clear that these applications are solely by way of personal applications which are restricted to an invocation of the jurisdiction of this Court for the protection of the Petitioners\u2018 fundamental rights. This is also manifested by the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioners which are limited to declarations that the Proclamation marked \u2015P1\u2016 violate their fundamental rights under Article 12 (1) and/or Article 14 (1) (a) of the Constitution and Orders quashing \u2015P1\u2016 and related interim reliefs. The Petitioners do not pray for a declaration that His Excellency, the President has intentionally violated the Constitution or committed an abuse of the powers of his office. Thus, the Petitioners\u2018 applications before us cannot be logically connected with the entirely different nature of proceedings under and in terms of Article 38 (2) which set in motion the power of the legislature to impeach a President who is then in office and, in the exercise of that power of the Legislature, provide for the Legislature to request the Supreme Court to inquire into and report on the allegation or allegations contained in a resolution. Sixthly, the mere fact that Article 38 (2) provides for any Member of Parliament to give the Hon. Speaker notice of a resolution under Article 38 (2) does not mean that those Petitioners who are Members of Parliament will be entitled to or be able to have the Supreme Court inquire into and report on the merits of the resolution. The success or failure of the efforts of any Member of Parliament to have such a resolution inquired into and reported on by the Supreme Court is dependent entirely upon the resolution being supported by a minimum of one half of the Members of Parliament. Further, even in instances where a Member of Parliament gives notice of a resolution in terms of the procedure specified in Article 38 (2) of the Constitution for the impeachment of a President then in office and the Supreme Court does inquire into and furnish a report, the passing of that resolution is again dependent on not less than two thirds of the Members of Parliament [including those not present] voting in its favour in the exercise of the",

    "text": "legislative power of Parliament. Therefore, the mere existence of the procedure described in Article 38 (2) cannot deprive those Petitioners who are Members of Parliament of the inalienable right of every citizen of our country to invoke the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. To emphasise the point, the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court can be immediately invoked by any Member of Parliament in his capacity as a citizen of Sri Lanka and he can obtain a determination by this Court. His right to do so is not dependent on cobbling together the required majority of Members of Parliament. Thus, there is no valid comparison between the procedure specified in Article 38 (2) of the Constitution for the impeachment of a President then in office and the inalienable right of a Member of Parliament, as a citizen of Sri Lanka, to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court for the protection of fundamental rights. The submissions made on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General have also referred to the decision in MALLIKARACHCHI vs. SHIVA PASUPATHI [1985 1 SLR 74]. However, that decision is founded on the absolute immunity which was enjoyed by the President by operation of Article 35 (1) of the Constitution prior to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. The position is very different now with the introduction of the first proviso to Article 35 (1) by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which states \u201cProvided that nothing in this paragraph shall read and construed as restricting the right of any person to make an application under Article 126 against the Attorney-General, in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by the President, in his official capacity.\u201d. In fact, in paragraph [12] of his affidavit, the Secretary to His Excellency, the President has stated \u201cI admit that the first proviso to Article 35 (1) of the Constitution recognizes the right of any person to make an application under Article 126 against the Attorney General, in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by the President in his official capacity.\u201d. Thus, the decision in MALLIKARACHCHI vs. SHIVA PASUPATHI is of little relevance today. Further, it is seen that although it has been submitted on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General that \u201cThe judgment also opines that Article 38 also acts as an effective check on the President\u201fs powers under the 1978 Constitution\u201d, a perusal of the judgment shows that Sharvananda CJ only referred to the provisions of Article 38 and commented [at p.78] \u201cIt will thus be seen that the President is not above the law.\u201d That obiter comment cannot be taken as authority for the submission Article 38 strips this Court of its jurisdiction for the protection of the Petitioners\u2018 fundamental rights. In any event, even when the Constitution afforded full immunity to the President, his actions have been reviewed on the basis that \u201cimmunity shields only the doer and not the act\u201d (KARUNATHILAKA vs. DAYANANDA DISSANAYAKE [1991 1 SLR 157]) Thus, immunity, even in its former absolute",

    "text": "Finally, it has to be observed that the acceptance of the submission made by the Hon. Attorney General will render the first proviso to Article 35 (1) meaningless for the most part. That is because the President has an array of duties, powers and functions under the Constitution and many of the acts done or omitted to be done by the President in his official capacity will relate to his duties, powers and functions under the Constitution. Thus, if the submission made on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General is carried to its logical end, the result will be the emasculation of the first proviso to Article 35 (1). That cannot be permitted by this Court which must honour its constitutional duty under Article 4 (d) and vigorously protect the totality of its jurisdiction for the protection of fundamental rights conferred by Article 118 (b) read with Article 126 of the Constitution. For the aforesaid reasons, the submission made by the Hon. Attorney General and set out in (a) above \u2013 i.e: that the only remedy available to the Petitioner is under the mechanism provided by Article 38 (2) of the Constitution\u2014is rejected. The submission set out in (b) above will be considered next. In this regard, it has been submitted on behalf of the Attorney General that the dissolution of Parliament by the President does not constitute \u201cexecutive or administrative action\u201d falling within the purview of Article 126 of the Constitution and, therefore, is covered by the immunity granted by Article 35 (1) of the Constitution. Article 35 (1) of the 1978 Constitution stipulated that during the period when a President holds office, no proceedings can be instituted or continued against him in any court or tribunal in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by him in his official or private capacity. Thus, prior to the 19th Amendment, Article 35 (1) conferred a blanket immunity",

    "text": "upon a President [so long as he holds office] from being sued in respect of any act or omission done by him in his official capacity qua President or in his private capacity. However, as is well known, the proviso to Article 35 (1) introduced by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution introduced a very significant change. It states \u201cProvided that nothing in this paragraph shall be read and construed as restricting the right of any person to make an application under Article 126 against the Attorney-General, in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by the President, in his official capacity.\u201d. Thus, the proviso to Article 35 (1) entitles any person who complains that an act or omission by the President in his official capacity has violated a fundamental right of that person to institute a fundamental rights application under and in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution against the Hon. Attorney General and seek a determination by the Supreme Court with regard to his complaint. In other words, the proviso to Article 35 (1) makes acts or omissions by the President in his official capacity justiciable within the limited sphere of an invocation of the jurisdiction for the protection of fundamental rights conferred on the Supreme Court by Article 118 (b) read with Article 126 of the Constitution and subject to the stipulation that the Hon. Attorney General [and not the President] is to be made the Respondent to the fundamental rights application filed by that person. It hardly needs to be said that the Hon. Attorney General is to be named as the Respondent in the place of the President and as his representative. Since the proviso to Article 35 (1) grants the right to challenge acts or omission by the President \u201cin his official capacity\u201d only by way of the specific procedure of making a fundamental rights application under Article 126 of the Constitution, it follows that \u201cexecutive or administrative action\u201d by the President \u201cin his official capacity\u201d may be challenged in terms of the proviso to Article 35 (1). That is because Article 126 (1) stipulates \u201cThe Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any question relating to the infringement or imminent infringement by executive or administrative action of any fundamental right or language right declared and recognised by Chapter III or Chapter IV.\u201d [emphasis added] As mentioned earlier, it has been submitted on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General that the issue by His Excellency, the President of the Proclamation marked \u2015P1\u2016 stating that Parliament is dissolved does not constitute \u201cexecutive or administrative action\u201d and, therefore, cannot be made the subject of an application made under Article 126 of the Constitution in terms of the proviso to Article 35 (1) of the Constitution.",

    "text": "The Court must now examine the merits of that submission. In this regard, the Hon. Attorney General submits that Article 30 (1) of the Constitution describes the President as being the Head of State, the Head of the Executive and of the Government and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. He goes on to seek to draw a distinction between acts done by the President as the Head of State and as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces on the one hand and acts done by the President as the Head of the Executive and of the Government on the other hand. The Hon. Attorney General then submits that only acts done by the President as the Head of the Executive and of the Government can be regarded as acts done in the exercise of \u201cgeneral executive powers of governmental nature\u201d which constitute \u201cexecutive or administrative action\u201d subject to review under Article 126. He seeks to differentiate acts done by the President as the Head of State and as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and categorise such acts as those done in the exercise of the \u201cplenary powers of the Head of State\u201d and not done in the exercise of \u201cgeneral executive powers of governmental nature\u201d. On that basis, the Hon. Attorney General contends that acts done by the President as the Head of State and as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces are done in the exercise of the \u201cplenary powers of the Head of State\u201d and, therefore, do not constitute \u201cexecutive or administrative action\u201d which is justiciable under Article 126. The Hon. Attorney General goes on to submit that acts done by the President under the powers listed in Article 33 (2) of the Constitution [including the power of dissolving Parliament under Article 33 (2) (c)] are all acts done in the exercise of \u201cplenary executive powers\u201d of the President held by him as part of the \u201cplenary powers of the Head of State\u201d and are not \u201cacts done by the President in the exercise of his \u201cgeneral executive powers of governmental nature\u201d. On that basis, the Hon. Attorney General submits that the President\u2018s power of dissolving Parliament under Article 33 (2) (c) does not constitute \u201cexecutive or administrative action\u201d which is justiciable under Article 126. In support of his contention that there exists a \u2015special type\u2016 of executive power of the President which is in the nature of \u201cplenary executive powers\u201d exercised by the President in the capacity of the Head of State and not in the capacity of the Head of the Executive and Government, the Hon. Attorney General cites a passage from the SC Reference 2/2003 where five judges of this Court headed by His Lordship, S.N. Silva CJ stated;",

    "text": "\u201cThat in terms of the several Articles of the Constitution analysed in this opinion and upon interpreting its content in the context of the Constitution taken as a whole, the plenary executive power including the defence of Sri Lanka is vested and reposed in the President of the Republic of Sri Lanka. The Minister appointed in respect of the subject of defence has to function within the purview of the plenary power thus vested and reposed in the President [\u2026] The plenary executive power and the defence of Sri Lanka vested and reposed in the President includes the control of the Forces, the Army, the Navy and Air Force of which the President is the Commander-in-Chief as provided in Article 30 (1) of the Constitution.\u201d. The Hon. Attorney General has expressly submitted that the \u201cplenary executive power\u201d referred to by the Court in SC Reference 2/2003 is comparable to the \u201cplenary power of the Sovereign or in our context the Head of State\u201d. It appears the Hon. Attorney General seeks to equate the term \u201cplenary executive power\u201d used by the Court in SC Reference 2/2003 to a royal prerogative power which is subject to no restriction. Royal prerogative power is described in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary [5th ed at p.2331] as \u201cThe special right or privilege exercised by a monarch or head of State over all other people, which overrides the law and is in theory subject to no restriction\u201d. The word \u2015plenary\u2016 comes from the Latin \u201cplenus\u201d which means \u2015full\u2016. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary [5th ed. at p.2243] defines \u201cplenary\u201d as meaning \u201cComplete, entire, perfect, not deficient in any element or respect, absolute, unqualified\u201d. Black\u2018s Law Dictionary [9th ed. at p. 1273] defines \u201cplenary\u201d as meaning \u201cFull; complete; entire\u201d. Webster\u2018s New International Dictionary of the English Language [2nd ed. at p.1889] defines \u201cplenary\u201d as meaning \u201cFull; entire; complete; absolute; perfect; unqualified; as, a plenary license, authority.\u201d",

In this regard, it must be remembered that the President, who is the Head of State under the Constitution, is but a creature of the Constitution. His powers are only those which are specifically vested in him by the Constitution and the law. Equally, the exercise of these powers by the President are circumscribed by the provisions of the Constitution and the law. Thus, in SUGATHAPALA MENDIS vs. CHANDRIKA KUMARATUNGA [2008 2 SLR 339 at p. 374] Tilakawardane J stated, \u201cFurthermore, being a creature of the Constitution, the President's powers in effecting action of the Government or of state officers is also necessarily limited to effecting action by them that accords with",

Thus, the suggestion inherent in the submission made on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General that the President, in his capacity as the Head of State, has a species of inherent unrestricted omnipotent power which is akin to royal prerogative power held by a monarch, has to be emphatically rejected. Since 1972, this country has known no monarch and this Court must reject any submission that carries with it a suggestion to the contrary. It is apt to refer to the decision in VISUVALINGAM vs. LIYANAGE [1983 1 SLR 203 at p.222] where Samarakoon CJ emphatically rejected the proposition advanced by Deputy Solicitor General that the President of Sri Lanka has \u201cinherited the mantle of a Monarch\u201d.",

In SC Reference 2/2003, this Court did not suggest that the executive power of the defence of Sri Lanka and the control of the three Forces vested in the President or, for that matter, the executive powers of the Head of State vested in the President by Article 30 (1) of the Constitution are in any way superior to or different from the executive powers of the Head of the Executive and of the Government vested in the President by other Articles of the Constitution.

    "text": "The Constitution does not define or describe what is meant by the term \u201cexecutive or administrative action\u201d. It appears to assume that the words are adequately descriptive and speak for themselves. As far as I am aware, this Court has, advisedly, not ventured an attempt at defining the term. Instead, the question of whether an act or omission can be regarded as constituting \u201cexecutive or administrative action\u201d must be decided on the nature of the powers that are exercised, the nature of the act and the facts of each case. In PERERA vs. UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION [1978-79-80 1 SLR 128 at p. 137-138] Sharvananda J as he then was, observed, \u201cThe expression \u201eexecutive or administrative action\u201f embraces executive action of the state or its agencies or instrumentalities exercising Governmental functions. It refers to the exertion of state power in all its forms.\u201d To determine whether the act of dissolving Parliament falls within the ambit of executive or administrative action it is necessary to examine whether the power and nature of the act were executive or administrative. In this regard, it is to be noted that CHAPTER VII of the Constitution which is titled \u201cTHE EXECUTIVE - The President of the Republic\u201d is where the office of President is described, the manner of election and term of office of the President is specified, the duties and powers of the President are listed, the",

    "text": "accountability of the President to Parliament is stipulated, the immunity of the President from suit is formulated and several other provisions relevant to the office of President are set out. This shows that the office of the President and the powers he holds are of an executive character. That conclusion is solidified by Article 4 (b) of the Constitution which specifies that the President exercises the executive power of the people. This fact has been recognised in several decisions of this Court. Therefore, it would appear that the exercise of the power of dissolution of Parliament which is listed as one of the powers of the President in Article 33 which is within CHAPTER VII titled \u201cTHE EXECUTIVE The President of the Republic\u201d, is one manner in which the President exercises executive power. That, in turn, would suggest that the dissolution of Parliament by the President is an executive act which falls within the definition of \u201cexecutive or administrative action\u201d. In PARAMESWARY JAYATHEVAN vs. ATTORNEY GENERAL [1992 2 SLR 356 at p. 360] Kulathunga J observed, with Ramanathan J, Perera J and Wijetunga J agreeing, that acts done by public officers \u201cunder colour of office in the exercise or the purported exercise of government functions\u201d are ordinarily regarded as constituting \u201cexecutive or administrative action\u201d. In the present case, the issue by His Excellency, the President of the Proclamation marked \u2015P1\u2016 was undoubtedly done \u201cunder colour of office\u201d of the President and, further, done by the President \u201cin the exercise or the purported exercise of government functions\u201d if one were to use the words of Kulathunga J. This analysis is fortified by the comments of Fernando J in FAIZ vs. AG [1995 1 SLR 372, at p 381], where referring to the term \u2015executive or administrative\u2016 used in the Constitution, His Lordship stated \u201cThat phrase does not seek to draw a distinction between the acts of \u201chigh\u201d officials (as being \u201cexecutive\u201d), and other officials (as being \"administrative\u201d). \u201cExecutive\" is appropriate in a Constitution, and sufficient, to include the (official) acts of all public officers, high and low, and to exclude acts which are plainly legislative or judicial (and of course purely private acts not done under colour of office). The need for including \"administrative\" is because there are residual acts which do not fit neatly into this three-fold classification\u2026Thus \u201cadministrative\" is intended to enlarge the category of acts within the scope of Article 126; it serves to emphasise that what is excluded from Article 126 are only acts which are legislative or judicial\u2026\u201d",

Describing the impugned act of the Speaker, Marsoof J observed [at p 09-10], \u201cThis was an integral part of a sui generis function of Parliament which did not fit easily into the legislative executive or judicial spheres of government and bore a unique complexion in that, while being more disciplinary in nature, it could not be exercised by Parliament alone and had to be performed in concurrence with the President of Sri Lanka, as contemplated by Article 107(2) and (3) of the Constitution \u2026.

Referring to this maxim, Maxwell [12th ed at p. 293] states \u201cBy the rule usually known in the form of this Latin maxim, mention of one or more things of a particular class may be regarded as silently excluding all other members of the class\u2026\u201d Similarly, Bindra [7th ed. at p 147] states, \u201cThe express mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another. This maxim is the product of logic and common sense.\u201d Bindra states [10th ed. at p. 1281] \u201cIn construing a provision of the constitution, resort may be had to the well-recognised rule of construction contained in the maxim \u201eexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201f, and the expression of one thing in the Constitution may necessarily involve the exclusion of other things not expressed [Exp Yalladingham 1 Wall 243 (US); Brosnan v Maryland 12 Wheat 419 (US)].

    "text": "It appears to me that this is an appropriate instance in which the maxim should be applied to raise the inference that the exclusion of the power to declare War and Peace under Article 33 (2) (g) from the ambit of the Proviso to Article 35(1) of the Constitution denotes that all the other powers of the President which are listed in Article 33 (2) are, subject to review by way of an application under Article 126 in appropriate circumstances which demand the Court\u2018s review of those powers. No doubt some of the powers vested in the President by Article 33 (2) may not, in practice, be reviewable by an application under Article 126 depending on the facts before court. For example, it is hard to think of instances where the performance by the President of a purely ceremonial function [as under Article 33 (2) (b)] would be amenable to review by this Court. On the other hand, it is conceivable that several of the other executive powers vested in the president by Article 33 (2) (c) [other than under Article 33 (2) (g) which is expressly excluded] could be, in appropriate circumstances, subject to challenge under a fundamental rights application under Article 126. In this connection, it is relevant to mention here the decision in EDWARD SILVA vs. BANDARANYAKE [1997 1 SLR 92 at p. 95] where Fernando J, referring to the President\u2018s power of appointing Judges of the Supreme Court stated \u201cThe learned Attorney-General submitted that the President in exercising the power conferred by Article 107 had a \"sole discretion\". I agree with this view. This means that the eventual act of appointment is performed by the President and concludes the process of selection. It also means that the power is neither untrammelled nor unrestrained, and ought to be exercised within limits, for, as the learned Attorney-General said, the power is discretionary and not absolute. This is obvious. If, for instance, the President were to appoint a person who, it is later found, had passed the age of retirement laid down in Article 107(5), undoubtedly the appointment would be flawed: because it is the will of the People, which that provision manifests, that such a person cannot hold that office. Article 125 would then require this Court, in appropriate proceedings, to exercise its judicial power in order to determine those questions of age and ineligibility. Other instances which readily come to mind are the appointment of a non-citizen, a minor, a bankrupt, a person of unsound mind, a person who is not an Attorney-at-Law or who has been disbarred, or a person convicted of an offence involving moral turpitude.\u201d",

Although that was a decision where the Supreme Court was hearing an Application for Special Leave to Appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal, the principle laid down by the Court that an act of the President in the exercise of his powers under Article 33 (2) (h) is subject to review by the Court fortifies the conclusion reached above that all the powers listed in Article 33 (2) [except the power to declare War and Peace listed in Article 33 (2) (g)] are subject to review under Article 126 in appropriate circumstances. In this connection, Chief Justice Silva stated [at p 261], \u201cOn the other hand where the President enters into a treaty or accedes to a Covenant the content of which is `inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution or written law\u201f it would be a transgression of the limitation in Article 33 (f) cited above and ultra vires. Such act of the President would not bind the Republic qua state. This conclusion is drawn not merely in reference to the dualist theory referred to above but in reference to the exercise of governmental power and the limitations thereto in the context of Sovereignty as laid down in Article 3, 4 and 33(f) of the Constitution.\u201d His Lordship continued (at p. 263-264), \u201cTherefore the accession to the Optional Protocol in 1997 by the then President and Declaration made under Article 1, is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution specified above and is in excess of the power of the President as contained in Article 33(f) of the Constitution.

He submitted that therefore, this Court cannot impugn the Proclamation marked \u2015P1\u2016 since it gives the people the right to exercise their franchise. He further submitted that since the sovereignty of the people is exercised by Parliament through the Court, this Court cannot make any order which prevents the people from exercising their will through the exercise of their franchise. However, the guiding rule is that this Court is obliged to act to uphold the Rule of Law. Mr. de Silva\u2018s submission overlooks the fundamental premise that any exercise of franchise, must be at an election which is duly and lawfully held and which satisfies the Rule of Law. A departure from that rule will result in the negation of the requirement of the Rule of Law that an election must be lawfully called and be lawfully held and, thereby, adversely affect the results of an ensuing election. The basic principle is that nothing valid can result from an illegality. Therefore, I am of the view that the Court has ample jurisdiction and in fact a duty to examine whether \u2015P1\u2016 was issued in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.

In his affidavit the 2nd added Respondent has also submitted that these applications cannot be maintained because of the failure to include all Members of Parliament, who are necessary parties.

Such an attempt will render the Chapeau of Article 33 (2) (c) meaningless and redundant.\u201d It has been submitted that Article 70 (1) refers only to a \u201clegislature driven process\u201d where the Legislature requests the President to dissolve Parliament, and where the President \u201cmay\u201d exercise his powers and dissolve Parliament when such a request is made. Thus, it was submitted that Article 70 (1) gives the President a discretion to either accede to a request by Legislature or not, and that therefore, the proviso operates only as a fetter on Parliament with regard to the manner in which Parliament may request a dissolution, but that it remains at the President\u2018s discretion whether to accept or deny such request. It was further submitted that in any event, the proviso in Article 70 (1) must be construed as being limited in its operation to Article 70 and cannot apply to the separate power of dissolution conferred on the President by Article 33 (2) (c).",

Mr. Manohara de Silva, PC, appearing for the 2nd added Respondent, submitted that Article 33 (2) (c) was inserted by the 19th Amendment as a \u201csolution to the problem\u201d created by the introduction of Article 70 (1). He submitted that this was done to cater for situations such as, for instance, where an Appropriation Bill is defeated or where the exigencies of the circumstances make it necessary for the President to dissolve Parliament prior to the expiry of the four and a half year period referred to in the proviso to Article 70 (1). He submitted that Article 33 (2) (c) was deliberately introduced by the 19th Amendment because the earlier safeguards set out in provisos (b) and (d) of Article 70 (1) were removed by the 19th Amendment. Mr. de Silva demonstrated that since 1989, only two of the Parliaments elected by the people have had a single party or alliance with a majority. He submitted that in the context of this history of \u2015hung parliaments\u2016, the President must have the opportunity to dissolve Parliament where a deadlock or a harmful situation transpires. He went on to contend that, in view of this necessity, Article 33 (2) (c) was introduced by the 19th Amendment to give the President the overarching and unrestricted power to dissolve Parliament whenever he thought it necessary to do so. Mr. De Silva also submitted that Article 62 (2) is an \u201cunequivocal and unambiguous\u201d",

Mr. Ali Sabry, PC, appearing for the 3rd added Respondent, submitted that the Court must harmoniously construe and interpret the provisions of Articles 70, 62 (2) and 33 (2) (c) when determining the power vested in the President to dissolve Parliament. He submitted that Article 62 (2) is the empowering provision giving the President power to dissolve Parliament; that Article 70 (1) sets out the procedure for doing so; and that Article 33 (2) (c) identifies a separate power given to the President. He too categorised the provisions of 70 (1) as referring to a \u201clegislature driven process\u201d. Mr. Sabry also submitted that Article 33 (2) (c) was inserted by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution to cater for the removal of the safeguards which existed in the former Article 70 (as it existed prior to the 19th Amendment). Mr. Gamini Marapana, PC appearing for the 4th added Respondent submitted that Articles 33 (2) (c) and 62 (2) confer on the President a power to dissolve Parliament which is not subject to Article 70 (1) or any other provision. In support of this contention, he submitted that, if it had been intended that Article 33 (2) (c) should be subject to Article 70 (1), either Articles 33 (2) (c) and Article 62 (2) should have expressly stated that they were \u201csubject to Article 70 (1)\u201d or Article 70 (1) should have contained the words \u201cnotwithstanding the provisions in Articles 33 (2) (c) and Article 62 (2)\u201d. He went on to submit that the proviso to Article 70 (3) states that \u201cat any time while Parliament stands prorogued the President may by proclamation \u2026 (ii) subject to the provisions of this Article, dissolve Parliament.\u201d He contended that the use of the words \u201cat any time\u201d are important and operative words of the proviso to Article 70 (3) and must be given meaning. He submitted that the words \u201cat any time\u201d in the proviso to Article 70 (3) make it clear that the power of dissolving Parliament during a prorogation of Parliament may be exercised by the President at any time, without being subject to the restriction of the period of four and a half years referred to in the second paragraph of Article 70 (1). He argued that any other interpretation would render the words \u201cat any time\u201d in the proviso to Article 70 (3) redundant and superfluous and would thus contravene established rules of interpretation. Mr. Canishka Vitharana who appeared for the 5th added Respondent submitted that Article 33 (2) (c), Article 62 (2) and Article 70 (5) create a \u2015triangle\u2016 which comprehensively sets out an unfettered power vested in the President to dissolve",

He submitted that Article 62 (2) is posited \u201cin the middle\u201d of both triangles. Mr. Vitharana submitted that, in this instance, the President has acted within and in terms of the first triangle described above when he issued \u2015P1\u2016. Mr. Vitharana went on to submit that where there is a clash between the President and the Legislature and the President wishes to dissolve Parliament, the Constitution provides that the President\u2018s \u201cwill must prevail\u201d and that, thereby, the President is placed in a position of \u201csupremacy\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis the Legislature with regard to the dissolution of Parliament. The submissions made by the several learned counsel who appeared for the intervenient Petitioners accord with what has been submitted on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General and by learned counsel appearing for the added Respondents. In addition, Mr. Samantha Ratwatte, PC submitted that, since Article 3 of the Constitution declares that the sovereignty of the People includes the right to exercise the franchise and Article 83 of the Constitution stipulates that Article 3 is an \u201centrenched\u201d provision of the Constitution, the construction of any Article of the Constitution to have the effect of restricting the exercise of the right of franchise, would be a violation of the sovereignty of the people and be offensive to the Constitution. Mr. Choksy submitted that the Constitution dictates that the President holds a pre-eminent position vis-a-vis the Legislature and that the President\u2018s will must prevail over the Legislature. Mr. Warnasuriya submitted that Article 33A of the Constitution imposes a duty on the President to dissolve Parliament in circumstances where it is apparent that Parliament has \u201cfailed\u201d. Mr. Deekiriwewa described Article 62 (2) as an \u2015emergency door\u201d which empowered the President to dissolve Parliament when there \u201cis a crisis\u201d. Mr. Weerasekera submitted that the Petitioner in the present application [SC FR 351/2018] is not entitled to invoke the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court because the Petitioner is not differently circumstanced from other Members of Parliament.

The essence of the task before us is to examine these Articles and determine whether or not the Proclamation marked \u2015P1\u2016 has been issued in terms of and in compliance with the powers and procedures set out in these Articles. When doing so, we must keep in mind established and accepted principles of law which apply when a Court construes or interprets a Constitution. Learned counsel appearing for all the parties before us have inundated the Court with a plethora of decisions of the Courts and statements of the law by renowned and recognised writers on constitutional law. It will be appropriate to mention at this point some of those principles which we consider should be kept in mind when we determine these applications. The first rule is that words in a statute must be given their ordinary meaning. As Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statues states [12th ed. at p. 28-29] \u201cThe rule of construction is to \u201eintend the Legislature to have meant what they actually expressed\u201f. The object of all interpretation is to discover the intention of Parliament, \u201ebut the intention of Parliament must be deduced from the language used\u201f, for \u201eit is well accepted that the beliefs and assumptions of those who frame Acts of Parliament cannot make the law.\u201f Where the language is plain and admits of but one meaning, the task of interpretation can hardly be said to arise\u2026 Where, by the use of clear and unequivocal language capable of only one meaning, anything is enacted by the legislature, it must be enforced however harsh or absurd or contrary to common sense the result may be. The interpretation of a statute is not to be collected from any notions which may be entertained by the court as to what is just and expedient: words are not to be construed, contrary to their meaning, as embracing or excluding cases merely because no good reason appears why they should not be embraced or excluded. The duty of the court is to expound the law as it stands, and to \u201eleave the remedy (if one be resolved upon) to others.\u201d",

    "text": "Further, as Bindra observes [12th ed. at p. 205] at \u201cThe legislature is a proverbial good writer in its own field, no matter that august body is subject to periodic criticism. It is not competent for the court to proceed on the assumption that the legislature knows not what it says, or that it has made a mistake. We cannot assume a mistake in an Act of Parliament. If we think so, we should render many Acts uncertain by putting different constructions on them according to our individual conjectures. The draftsman of the Act may have made a mistake. If so, the remedy is for the legislature to amend it. The legislature is presumed not to have made a mistake even if there is some defect in the language used by the legislature, it is not for the court to add to or amend the language or by construction make up deficiencies which are left in the Act.\u201d. These principles have been followed by this Court. Thus, Amerasinghe J stated, in SOMAWATHIE vs. WEERASINGHE [1990 2 SLR 121 at p. 124], \u201cHow should the words of this provision of the Constitution be construed? It should be construed according to the intent of the makers of the Constitution. Where, as in the Article before us, the words are in themselves precise and unambiguous and there is no absurdity, repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the Constitution, the words themselves do best declare that intention. No more can be necessary than to expound those words in their plain, natural, ordinary, grammatical and literal sense.\u201d The next principle of interpretation which should be mentioned is that, where there is more than one provision in a statute which deal with the same subject and differing constructions of the provisions are advanced, the Court must seek to interpret and apply the several provisions harmoniously and read the statute as a whole. That rule of harmonious interpretation crystallises the good sense that all the provisions of a statute must be taken into account and be made to work together and cohesively to enable the statute to achieve its purpose.",

III of the Constitution, we are not in the happy position of a learned Judge of the United States, who is said to have observed that there was no limit to the power of judicial legislation under the \"due process\" clause of the 5th and 14th Amendments, except the sky. I consider it to be both legally and constitutionally unsound, even though the invitation has been extended to us by learned counsel, to eviscerate the Constitution by our own conceptions of social, political or economic Justice\". A guiding principle when a Court interprets the Constitution is that the Court must adopt an approach which enforces the Rule of Law, which is one of the fundamental principles upon which our Constitution is built. Thus, in WIJEYARATNE vs. WARNAPALA [SC FR 305/2008 decided on 22nd September 2009 at p.5] Sripavan J, as he then was, stated \u201cIt has been firmly stated in several judgments of this Court that the \u201cRule of Law\u201d is the basis of our Constitution. (Vide Vishvalingam vs. Liyanage (1983) 1SLR 236; Premachandra vs. Jayawickrema (1994) 2SLR 90. `If there is one principle which runs through the entire fabric of the Constitution, it is the principle of the Rule of Law and under the Constitution, it is the judiciary which is entrusted with the task of keeping every organ of the State within the limits of the law and thereby making the Rule of Law meaningful and effective\u201f \u2013 Bhagwati J in Gupta and Others vs. Union of India, (1982) AIR (SC) 197.\u2016",

As Fernando J emphasised in DE SILVA vs. ATUKORALE [1993 1 SLR 283 at p. 296-297], \u201cThe powers of public authorities are therefore essentially different from those of private persons. A man making his will may, subject to any rights of his dependants, dispose of his property just as he may wish. He may act out of malice or a spirit of revenge, but in law this does not affect his exercise of his power. In the same way a private person has an absolute power to release a debtor, or, where the law permits, to evict a tenant, regardless of his motives. This is unfettered discretion. But a public authority may do neither unless it acts reasonably and in good faith and upon the lawful and relevant grounds of public interest. Unfettered discretion is wholly inappropriate to a public authority, which possesses powers solely in order, that it may use them for the public good.\u201d",

Therefore, powers of Government are kept separated to prevent the erosion of political freedom and liberty and abuse of power. This will lead to controlling of one another. There are three distinct functions involved in a Government of a State, namely legislative, the executive and the judicial functions. Those three branches of Government are composed of different powers and function as three separate organs of Government. Those three organs are constitutionally of equal status and also independent from one another. One organ should not control or interfere with the powers and functions of another branch of Government and should not be in a position to dominate the others and each branch operates as a check on the others. This is accomplished through a system of \u201cchecks and balances\u201d, where each branch is given certain powers so as to check and balance the other branches\u2026 The doctrine of separation of powers is enshrined in Article 4 read with Article 3 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.\u201d",

Thus, in GAMAGE vs. PERERA [2006 3 Sri L.R. 354 at p.359] Shirani Bandaranayake CJ stated: \u201cArticle 80(3) of the Constitution refers to a Bill becoming law and reads as follows: \u201cWhere a Bill becomes law upon the certificate of the President or the Speaker, as the case may be, being endorsed thereon, no Court or tribunal shall inquire into, pronounce upon or in any manner call in question, the validity of such Act on any ground whatsoever\u201d. The aforesaid Article thus had clearly stated that in terms of that Article, the constitutional validity of any provision of an Act of Parliament cannot be called in question after the certificate of the President or the Speaker is given. Reference was made to the provisions in Article 80(3) of the Constitution and its applicability by Sharvananda, J. in Re the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and had expressed his Lordship\u201fs views in the following terms: `Such a law cannot be challenged on any ground whatsoever even if it conflicts with the provisions of the Constitution, even if it is not competent for Parliament to enact it by a simple majority or two third majority.\u2016 Finally, I wish to set out here two more principles which must guide us in deciding this application. Firstly, this Court has a sacred duty to uphold the integrity and supremacy of the Constitution. Thus, in PREMACHANDRA vs. MAJOR MONTAGUE JAYAWICKREMA [supra, at p. 111] the Court declared \u201cIn Sri Lanka, however, it is the Constitution which is supreme, and a violation of the Constitution is prima facie a matter to be remedied by the Judiciary\u201d. Secondly, this Court must be mindful of the guidelines brought to our attention by the Hon. Attorney General when he concluded his submissions before us by citing the words of the Supreme Court of the United States of America in BAKER vs. CARR [369 U.S. 186 1962] which declared \u201cThe Court\u201fs authority - possessed of neither the purse nor the sword \u2013 ultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral sanction. Such feeling must be nourished by the Court\u201fs complete detachment, in fact and in appearance, from political entanglements and by abstention from injecting itself into the clash of political forces in political settlements.\u201d Having set out the aforesaid principles which are relevant when determining the applications before us, I must now examine the nature, meaning and effect of Articles 33 (2) (c), 62 (2) and 70.",

    "text": "To start with, a reading of Article 33 in its entirety sheds light on how Article 33 (2) (c) is to be understood. First, Article 33 (1) lists the principal constitutional duties of the President. It is significant to note that the first and foremost of those duties cast upon the President is the duty to \u201censure that the Constitution is respected and upheld.\u201d. Thereafter, Article 33 (2) states that \u201cIn addition to the powers, duties and functions expressly conferred on or imposed on the President by the Constitution or other written law, the President shall have the power -\u201c to do any of the eight types of acts listed in Article 33 (2) (a) to (h). The President\u2018s power \u201cto summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament\u201d is one of those eight types of power and is listed in Article 33 (2) (c). It is significant that, although Article 33 (2) (c) states that the President has the power to summon, dissolve and prorogue Parliament, Article 33 (2) (c) does not state how that power is to be exercised or state the manner in which the President is entitled to exercise that power. In the absence of any words in Article 33 (2) (c) which describe the manner in which the President is entitled to exercise the power of summoning, proroguing and dissolving Parliament, the Court must look at the other provisions of the Constitution for guidance to ascertain how the power referred to in Article 33 (2) (c) may be lawfully exercised by the President. The principle that the Court should do so is illustrated in Bindra\u2018s statement [10th ed. at p.48] that \u201cIn construing a constitutional provision, it is the duty of the court to have recourse to the whole instrument, if necessary, to ascertain the true intent and meaning of any particular provision [Dounes v Bidwell 182 US 244]. The subject, the context, and the intention of the body inserting a word in the federal Constitution are all to be considered in determining its construction. [M\u201fCulloch v Maryland 4 Wheat 316 (US)].\u201d. When that is done, it is seen that the only provision in the Constitution which sets out the manner in which Parliament may be summoned, prorogued or dissolved by the President is Article 70. A perusal of Article 70 shows that it is structured in a manner which comprehensively and in detail sets out the manner and circumstances in which the President may summon,",

To start with, the first paragraph of Article 70 (1) specifies that a summoning, prorogation or dissolution of Parliament by the President is to be by effected by a Proclamation issued by the President.

Attorney General and the added Respondents and, in contrast, described as an \u201cexception\u201d by Mr. Alagaratnam who appears for the Petitioners in SC FR 358/2018] stipulates restrictions on the President\u2018s power to dissolve Parliament. Next, Articles 70 (2), (3), (5), (6) and (7) specify requirements placed on the President\u2018s power of summoning Parliament and the instances where the President is mandatorily required to summon Parliament within specified time frames. Finally, Article 70 (3) delineates the limits and requirements placed on the President\u2018s power to prorogue Parliament. Thus, the only provision in the Constitution which states the instrument by which the President can exercise his power of summoning, proroguing and dissolving Parliament is the first paragraph of Article 70 (1) which stipulates that the President is to issue a Proclamation to such effect. That was the position under the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council, 1946 in which Article 15 (1) stated that the Governor may \u201cby Proclamation summon, prorogue, or dissolve Parliament\u201d and also under the 1972 Republican Constitution in which Articles 41 (1), Article 41 (2) and Article 41 (6) read with Article 21 (b) make it clear that the President can exercise his power of summoning, proroguing and dissolving Parliament only by issuing a Proclamation. Article 70 (1) of the 1978 Republican Constitution continued in the same vein and stated that the power of the President to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament is to be exercised by the President issuing a Proclamation. Accordingly, the conclusion must be that Article 70 (1) in the present Constitution [as amended by the 19th Amendment] follows that long constitutional history and makes it clear that the President can exercise his power of summoning, proroguing and dissolving Parliament only by issuing a Proclamation to such effect.

Referring to situations such as in the present case where a statute contains both a general provision and a specific provision dealing with the same subject, Bindra [12th ed. at p 732] states \u201cWhere there is in the same statute a specific provision and also a general provision that, in its most comprehensive sense, would include matters embraced in the former, the particular provision must be operative and the general provision must be taken to affect only such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions of the particular provision [Mulji Tribhovan Sevak v Dakore Municipality AIR 1922 Bom 247; Harnam Singh v State of Punjab AIR 1960 Punj 186, p 191]. When there are two sections in a statute, one dealing specially with any particular subject which is also included in some of the provisions of another section, which is couched in general terms, the provisions of this latter section should not affect the provisions of the former section unless there is specific provision to the contrary in the statute itself. Where there are two articles (limitation) which may possibly govern a case, one more general and the other more particular and specific, the latter article ought to be adopted [Magundappa v Javali AIR 1965 Mys 237, p 238 per Tukol J; Manichvasagam v Muthuveeraswami AIR 1963 Mad 362, p 364 per Ram Chandra CJ].\u201d In these circumstances, the inescapable inference is that the detailed provisions set out in Article 70 with regard to the manner and method of the exercise of the President\u2018s power of summoning, proroguing and dissolving Parliament and the restrictions and limits placed on that power must be read together with and are inextricably linked to the power referred to in Article 33 (2) (c) of the Constitution. The resulting conclusion must be that the President\u2018s power of summoning, proroguing and dissolving Parliament referred to in Article 33 (2) (c) of the Constitution can only be exercised under and in terms of the scheme set out in Article 70 and is circumscribed and",

    "text": "limited by the provisions of Article 70 and can be exercised only within and in conformity with the provisions of Article 70. This conclusion is fortified by the wording of Article 48 (1) and (2) which refer to the President dissolving parliament acting \u201cin the exercise of his powers under Article 70.\u201d and contemplate no possibility of the President having dissolved Parliament without reference to Article 70. Accepting the Respondent\u2018s contention that the power of issuing a Proclamation summoning, proroguing or dissolving Parliament under Article 33 (2) (c) and ignoring the provisions of Article 70, will render the entirety of Article 70 redundant and superfluous and thereby offend the rule that statutory interpretation must ensure that no provision of the Constitution is ill-treated in that manner. The added Respondents have also submitted that following the introduction of the second paragraph of Article 70 (1) by the 19th Amendment and the deletion of the powers vested in the President under Article 70 (1) of the 1978 Constitution to dissolve Parliament on the rejection of a statement of Government Policy following the completion of the first Session of Parliament or following the rejection of two consecutive Appropriation Bills [Article 70 (1) (b) and Article 70 (1) (d) of the 1978 Constitution], the framers of the 19th Amendment realized that it was inadvisable to render the President unable to dissolve Parliament for four and half years even in such situations where it was evident that Parliament was dysfunctional. They contend that Article 33 (2) (c) was intentionally inserted by the 19th Amendment as a new provision to preserve with the President a power to dissolve Parliament at any time and at his sole discretion irrespective of the confines of Article 70 (1). We see nothing on the face of Article 33 (2) (c) or in the Determination of this Court IN RE THE 19TH AMENDMENT [2015] [SC SD 04/2015] which supports that view. That submission is hypothetical and cannot be accepted. In any event, following the 19th Amendment, Article 70 (1) and Article 33 (2) (c) must be read and understood as they now appear in the Constitution. The Court cannot dispute or review these provisions. The Court is expressly prohibited from doing so by Article 80(3) which states that \u201cWhere a Bill becomes law upon the certificate of the President or the Speaker, as the case may be being endorsed thereon, no court or tribunal shall inquire into, pronounce upon or in any manner call in question, the validity of such Act on any",

    "text": "ground whatsoever.\u201d That restriction was clearly declared by this Court in GAMAGE vs. PERERA (supra) which was cited earlier. Accordingly, the submission made on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General and by the added Respondents that Article 33 (2) (c) confers a sui generis, independent, overarching and unfettered power upon the President to dissolve Parliament at his sole discretion and without reference to Article 70 has to be rejected. It must also be stressed that, as set out earlier when identifying the relevant principles of the law and statutory interpretation, this Court has, time and again, stressed that our law does not permit vesting unfettered discretion upon any public authority whether it be the President or any officer of the State. The suggestion that Article 33 (2) (c) vests in the President an unfettered discretion to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament at his sole wish and without reference to the clear and specific provisions of Article 70 is anathema to that fundamental rule and therefore must be rejected. As this Court has emphasized on several occasions, the President is subject to the Constitution and the law, and must act within the terms of the Constitution and the law. As this Court has also stated on several occasions, the guiding principle must be the furtherance and maintenance of the Rule of Law. The submission made on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General and the added Respondents runs counter to that principle and must be rejected. Further, accepting the contention advanced by the Hon. Attorney General and the added Respondents that Article 33 (2) (c) vests an unfettered power upon the President to dissolve Parliament whenever he may wish to do so, will result in an absurd and untenable situation where any President, whomsoever he may be, will have the absolute power to dissolve Parliament whenever he may wish to - even in order to prevent his impeachment or because the composition of a newly elected Parliament is not to his liking. No doubt, a duly elected President is not likely to act in such a manner. But, that expectation, however confident it may be, does not detract from the duty placed upon the Court to remain alive to the danger inherent in accepting the aforesaid contention. The principles of interpretation referred to above make it clear that such an interpretation should not be accepted unless the express words in the Constitution dictate so. As explained earlier, that is not the case.",

    "text": "It should also be mentioned that accepting the contention advanced by the Hon. Attorney General and the added Respondents will vest an unfettered power upon the President to dissolve Parliament whenever he may wish to do so and sans any restrictions. That will result in empowering a President to place the very continuation of any Parliament subject to his sole power and, thereby, place a President in a position of supreme power over the Parliament. That would then negate the effectiveness of Article 33A which stipulates that the President shall be responsible to Parliament for the due exercise, performance and discharge of his powers, duties and functions under the Constitution and written law. Such a development will be inimical to the principle enunciated by this Court that all three organs of Government have an equal status and must be able to continue to be able to maintain effective checks and balance on each other. The submission made by the Hon. Attorney General and the added Respondents who all sought to categorise the power of dissolution of Parliament created and recognised by Article 33 (2) (c) read together with and subject to Article 70 (1) as a solely \u2015legislative driven dissolution\u201d and postulated the existence of a separate and independent \u2015executive driven dissolution\u201d based solely on Article 33 (2) (c) has to be rejected for the same reasons set out above. This submission is without substance since any dissolution of Parliament [other than upon the expiry of the Parliament\u2018s full term of five years] has to be by way of a Proclamation made by the President and is, therefore, \u201cexecutive driven\u201d to use the words of the Hon. Attorney General and added Respondents. In this connection it is also relevant to note that Article 70 (1) confers upon the President a discretion with regard to whether or not to dissolve Parliament either at the request of Parliament before the expiry of four and half years from the date of that Parliament\u2018s first sitting or without the intervention of Parliament after the expiry of that period of four and a half years. Thus, in any foreseeable situation, the dissolution of Parliament before the end of its term of five years is ultimately the act of the Executive. The only instance where Parliament can be dissolved without an act of the President exercising his powers subject to the limitations under Article 70 (1) is upon the expiry of the Parliament\u2018s term of five years specified in Article 62 (2). The Hon. Attorney General and the added Respondents have stressed on the words at the start of Article 32 which state \u2015In addition to\u201d [\u201c\u0d85\u0db8\u0dad\u0dbb\u0dc0\u2016]. They contend that these words denote that the power given to the President by Article 33 (2) (c) to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament is additional to, and independent of Article 70.",

Thereafter, Article 70 (5) (b) states \u2015Upon the dissolution of Parliament by virtue of the provisions of paragraph (2) of Article 62, the President shall forthwith by Proclamation fix a date or dates for the election of Members of Parliament, and shall summon the new Parliament to meet on a date not later than three months after the date of such Proclamation.\u2016 It is equally clear that Article 70 (5) (b) only refers to a dissolution of Parliament by effluxion of time as specified by Article 62 (2) upon the expiry of Parliament\u2018s full term of five years - i.e: an automatic dissolution of Parliament at the end of five years without any intervention by the President. In this connection, since it has been previously concluded that Parliament can be dissolved by the President only by the issue of a Proclamation, the absence of a reference to \u2015a Proclamation dissolving Parliament\u2016 in Article 70 (5) (b) is significant and leads to the irresistible inference that the words \u2015Upon the dissolution of Parliament by virtue of the provisions of paragraph (2) of Article 62,\u2016 in Article 70 (5) (b) only refer to and mean an automatic dissolution of Parliament at the end of five years without any intervention by the President as mentioned in Article 62 (2). It is for that reason that Article 70 (5) (b) does not refer to an issue of a Proclamation dissolving Parliament and only refers to the fixing of dates of the General Election and summoning of the new Parliament \u2013 i.e: after the previous Parliament, has automatically dissolved at the end of its five year term.

As the Indian Supreme Court stated in HH MAHARAHADHIRAJA MADHAV RAO JIVAJI RAO vs. UNION OF INDIA [1971 1 SCC 85], \u201cA constitutional provision will not be interpreted in the attitude of a lexicographer, with one eye on the provision and the other on the lexicon.\u201d Thus, the conclusion must be that Article 62 (2) does not vest any separate or independent power in the President to dissolve Parliament outside the mechanism specified in Article 70 (1).",

    "text": "To now turn to Article 70 (1), as I stated earlier, this Article comprehensively sets out the manner and method in which the President can summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament. The question before us is the President\u2018s power of dissolution of Parliament. The second paragraph of Article 70 (1) states, \u2015Provided that the President shall not dissolve Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than four years and six months from the date appointed for its first meeting, unless Parliament requests the President to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the whole number of Members (including those not present), voting in its favour.\u2016. Thus, this Article stipulates in no uncertain terms that the President shall not dissolve Parliament during the first four and a half years from the date of its first meeting unless the President has been requested to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two thirds of the members of Parliament. The second paragraph of Article 70 (1) makes it clear that, even upon receipt of such a request during the first four and a half years of the term of Parliament, the President has the discretion to decide whether or not he is to comply with such a request made by Parliament \u2013 i.e: the President is entitled to decide whether to dissolve Parliament or refrain from doing so, notwithstanding the request by Parliament. The second paragraph of Article 70 (1) makes it also clear that, after the expiry of four and a half years of the term of Parliament, the President may dissolve Parliament at his discretion, irrespective of the wishes of the Members of Parliament. Thus, the second paragraph of Article 70 (1) makes it crystal clear that the power of the President to dissolve Parliament by Proclamation is subject to and limited by the aforesaid two conditions. Therefore, since as concluded earlier, Article 33 (2) (c) must be read with and is inextricably linked to Article 70, the power of the President to dissolve Parliament which is referred to in Article 33 (2) (c) is subject to and limited by the aforesaid two conditions stipulated in second paragraph of Article 70 (1). The added Respondents have contended that the second paragraph of Article 70 (1) is a \u201cproviso\u201d which applies only to Article 70 (1) and cannot have any application to Article 33 (2) (c) or 62 (2).

    "text": "has contended that the second paragraph of Article 70 (1) is not a \u201cproviso\u201d and is an \u201cexception\u201d which is of general application to all related Articles of the Constitution. However, there is no necessity to examine such intricacies for the simple reason that all parties agree that the second paragraph of Article 70 (1) must, at the minimum, apply to Article 70 (1). As stated earlier, the first paragraph of Article 70 (1) makes it clear that any dissolution of Parliament by the President must be by way of a Proclamation issued by the President. It follows that, since the second paragraph of Article 70 (1) undisputedly applies to the first paragraph of Article 70 (1), any Proclamation issued by the President dissolving Parliament can be issued only subject to the limitations specified in the second paragraph of Article 70 (1). Consequently, any dissolution of Parliament referred to in Article 33 (2) (c) and Article 62 (2) can only be effected by way of a Proclamation issued under Article 70 (1) which, in turn, can be issued only subject to the limitations specified in the second paragraph of Article 70 (1). Next, we must consider the proviso to Article 70 (3) which states that \u2015Provided that at any time while Parliament stands prorogued the President may by Proclamation - (i) summon Parliament for an earlier date, not being less than three days from the date of such Proclamation, or (ii) subject to the provisions of this Article, dissolve Parliament.\u201d Article 70 (3) states that the President may, subject to the provisions of \u201cthis Article\u201d, issue a Proclamation dissolving Parliament even during a time when Parliament stands prorogued. The stipulation in Article 70 (3) that the issue of a Proclamation dissolving Parliament must be subject to the provisions of \u201cthis Article\u201d must be read to mean a reference to the entirety of Article 70. That would necessarily include the entirety of Article 70 (1) and, in particular, the second paragraph of Article 70 (1). The added Respondents have contended that the first line of the proviso to Article 70 (3), which start with the words \u201cProvided that at any time..,\u201d denotes that the time period of four and a half years specified in the second paragraph of Article 70 (1) does not apply to instances where the President dissolves Parliament at a time during which Parliament has been prorogued. In support of this argument, the added Respondents have submitted that the words \u201cat any time\u201d in the proviso to Article 70 (3) make it clear that the power of dissolving Parliament during a prorogation of Parliament may be exercised by the President at any time, without being subject to the restriction of the period of four and a half years referred to in the second paragraph of Article 70 (1). They argue that any other interpretation would render the words \u201cat any time\u201d in the proviso to Article 70 (3)",

The submission made by some of the added Respondents that, irrespective of whether or not the provisions of the Constitution allow the issue of the Proclamation, the exigencies of the prevailing circumstances require that an election be held and, therefore, the Petitioners are not entitled to maintain this application, must be emphatically rejected. The Constitution governs the nation. Disregarding the Constitution will cast our country into great peril and mortal danger. The Court has a duty to uphold and enforce the Constitution. It is apt to reiterate and emphasise this Court\u2018s declaration in PREMACHANDRA vs. MAJOR MONTAGUE JAYAWICKREMA [supra, at p. 112] that, \u201cIn Sri Lanka, however, it is the Constitution which is supreme, and a violation of the Constitution is prima facie a matter to be remedied by the Judiciary\u201d. It has been said by some of the added Respondents that refusing the Petitioners\u2018 applications will enable a General Election to be held in pursuance of the Proclamation marked \u2015P1\u2016 and, therefore, justified because it will give effect to the franchise of the people. That submission is not correct. Giving effect to the franchise of the people is not achieved by the Court permitting a General Election held consequent to a dissolution of Parliament which has been effected contrary to the provision of the Constitution. Such a General Election will be unlawfully held and its result will be open to question. A General Election will be valid only if it is lawfully held. Thus, a General Election held consequent to a dissolution of Parliament which has been done contrary to the provisions of the Constitution will not be a true exercise of the franchise of the people. Some of the added Respondents have submitted that the prevailing circumstances require that a General Election be held and that the Court should permit a General Election to be held. The Court cannot be motivated by those considerations which are inevitably tinged with political considerations and other issues outside the scope of the task before us, which is determining the constitutional validity of the Proclamation marked \u2015P1\u2016. In any event, it appears to me that, there is ample provision in the second paragraph of Article 70 (1) for Parliament, which is under a duty to act in accordance with the will of people, to take steps to have a lawful General Election where it considers it necessary to do so. The final point the Court must address is the submission made with regard to the basis of relief. Counsel for one of the intervenient Petitioners submitted that the Petitioners are",

In JAYANETTI vs. LAND REFORM COMMISSION [1984 2 SLR 172] His Lordship Justice Wanasundera said that; \u2015Article 12 of our constitution is similar in content to Article 14 of the Indian constitution. The Indian Supreme Court has held that Article 14 combines the English Law Doctrine of the Rule of Law with the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the US Constitution. We all know that the Rule of Law was a Fundamental principle of English Constitutional law and it was a right of the subject to challenge any act of the state from whichever organ it emanated and compel it is to justify its legality. It was not confined only to legalization, but extended to every class and category of acts done by or at the instance of the state. That concept is included and embodied in Article 12.\u2016 In SHANMUGAM SIVARAJAH vs. OIC, TERRORIST INVESTIGATION DIVISION AND OTHERS, [SC FR 15/2010, SC Minutes 27. 07. 2017], the Supreme Court endorsed the new doctrine that Rule of Law forms a part of Article 12 (1).

    "text": "Government Branch Press Vs Beliappa AIR1979 SC 429, that :- \u2015In order to establish discrimination or denial of equal protection it is not necessary to establish the due observance of the law in the case of others who form part of that class in previous instances. The Rule of Law, which postulates equal subjection to the law, requires the observance of the law in all cases.\u2016 Thus, I am unable to agree with the submission that Article 12 (1) of the Constitution recognizes \u2017classification\u2018 as the only basis for relief. In a Constitutional democracy where three organs of the State exercise their power in trust of the People, it is a misnomer to equate \u2017Equal protection\u2018 with \u2017reasonable classification\u2018. It would clothe with immunity a vast majority of executive and administrative acts that are otherwise reviewable under the jurisdiction of Article 126. More pertinently, if this Court were to deny relief merely on the basis that the Petitioners have failed to establish \u2017unequal treatment\u2018, we would in fact be inviting the State to \u2017equally violate the law.\u2018 It is blasphemous and would strike at the very heart of Article 4 (d) which mandates every organ of the State to \u2015respect, secure and advance the fundamental rights recognized by the Constitution\u2016. Rule of Law dictates that every act that is not sanctioned by the law and every act that violates the law be struck down as illegal. It does not require positive discrimination or unequal treatment. An act that is prohibited by the law receives no legitimacy merely because it does not discriminate between people. The Proclamation marked \u2015P1\u2016 has been issued outside legal limits and has resulted in a violation of Petitioner\u2018s rights both in his capacity as a parliamentarian legitimately elected to represent the People and in the capacity of a citizen who is entitled to be protected from any arbitrary exercise of power. For the reasons set out above, I hold that the Petitioners\u2018 rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution have been violated by the issue of the Proclamation filed with the petition in SC FR 351/2018 marked \u2015P1\u2016 and make order quashing the said Proclamation and declaring the said Proclamation marked \u2015P1\u2016 null, void ab initio and without force or effect in law. This judgment and the aforesaid orders will apply to applications in nos. SC FR 351/2018. SC FR No. 352/2018, SC FR No. 353/2018, SC FR No. 354/2018, SC FR No. 355/2018, SC FR No. 356/2018, SC FR No. 358/2018, SC FR No. 359/2018, SC FR No. 360/2018, and SC FR No. 361/2018 in which the same issues as those in this application are before this Court.",
