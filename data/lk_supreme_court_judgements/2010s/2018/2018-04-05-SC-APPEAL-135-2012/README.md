Plaintiff Respondent Appellant Ranawaka Arachchige Chandrakanthi Ranawaka had filed the

present appeal against the decision of the Provincial High Court (Civil Appellate) of the North

Central Province holden in Anuradhapura in Appeal Case No. NCP/HCCA/ARP/ 878/2010 dated

14.12.2011.

When this matter was supported for leave, the Supreme Court after considering the material

placed on behalf of the Plaintiff Respondent Appellant had granted leave to appeal on the

questions set out in paragraph 7 (f) (g) (h) and (k) of the petition, and re-numbered those issues as

1,2,3,4, in the journal entry dated 30.07.2012 which reads as follows;

1. Did the Learned Judges of the Provincial High Court (Civil Appellate) of the North Central

Province err in law, by holding that the statement complained of was a privileged

statement, and hence not defamatory?

2. Did the Learned Judges of the Provincial High Court (Civil Appellate) of the North Central

Province err in law, by holding that animus injuriandi was not attributable to the

Respondent in respect of the said statement complained of?

3. Did the Learned Judges of the Provincial High Court (Civil Appellate) of the North Central

Province err in law, by holding that the Respondent could not be held responsible for the

publication of the said statement complained of?

4. Did the Learned Judges of the Provincial High Court (Civil Appellate) of the North Central

Province err in law, by holding that the Petitioners claim of loss and damage to reputation,

good name, and professional standing and prospects, due to the statement complained of

was not substantiated by evidence?

4 As revealed before this court the Defendant Appellant Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) to the present appeal was the Revenue Administrator at Lankapura Pradeshiya Sabha

in the North Central Province. The Plaintiff Respondent Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioner) who is a legal practitioner in the Polonnaruwa and Hingurakgoda Courts, was engaged

by the said Lankapura Pradeshiya Sabha to attend to all legal matters of the said Pradeshiya Sabha.

The Petitioner had initiated legal proceedings initially against two Defendants namely the

Respondent above named and the Lankapura Pradeshiya Sabha claiming damagers of Rs.

2,500,000/- in the District Court of Polonnaruwa. The events that lead to initiate the said

proceedings before the District Court can be summarized as follows;

a) On or about 31st January 2005 the monthly meeting of the Pradeshiya Sabha was held at

its Auditorium

b) During the said meeting, certain issues were raised with regard to the recovery of lease

rentals by initiating legal proceedings

c) When the said issues were raised, certain queries were made from the Respondent who

is the Revenue Administrator of the Pradeshiya Sabha with regard to initiating

proceedings before the Magistrates Court

d) Answering the said issues raised, the Respondent made a statement to the effect that

the Appellant appeared on behalf of the opposing party in a Magistrates Court

proceeding against the interest of the Pradeshiya Sabha, and therefore steps were taken

to retain a new Attorney at Law in order to send letters of demand at a lower fee.

e) The said reply given by the Respondent at the meeting of the Pradeshiya Sabha was

reported in the Dinamina Daily Sinhala News Paper on 31st March 2005

5

f) Whilst initiating the proceedings before the District Court, the Petitioner had claimed

that, as a consequence of the said publication based on the utterances made by the

Respondent, the Petitioner suffered loss and damage to her reputation, good name,

professional standing and prospects

As revealed before us, the Petitioner had withdrawn her case against the 2nd Defendant Pradeshiya

Sabha and proceeded only against the 1st Defendant who is the Respondent to the present

application.

The trial before the District Court of Polonnaruwa was commenced after recording 07 admissions,

06 issues in favour of the Plaintiff and 09 issues in favour of the Defendant. At the conclusion of the

District Court Trial, the learned District Judge of Polonnaruwa answering the 1st to the 6th issues in

favour of the Plaintiff had granted damages in sum of Rupees 15 lacks to the Plaintiff.

Being dissatisfied with the said decision of the District Judge, the Respondent appealed to the

Provincial High Court (Civil Appellate) of the North Central Province. During the said appeal, the

judges of the Provincial High Court (Civil Appellate) of the North Central Province, by the judgment

dated 14.12.2011, set aside the judgment of the District Judge of Polonnaruwa.

The instant appeal is against the said decision of the Provincial High Court, and when the matter

was supported for leave, this court had granted leave, on the questions of law referred to above.

When considering the appeal before us it is important for this court to first satisfy, whether the

statement referred to above had in fact been made by the Respondent and whether it was made to

or published to some person other than the person defamed. This position was discussed by R.G.

McKerron as follows;

6

By publication is meant the act of making known the defamatory matter to some person or

persons other than the person defamed.

(R.G. McKerron, Law of Delict 7th Edition at page 183)

In the case of the Independent News Papers Ltd V. Devadas (1983) 2 Sri LR 505 it was held that,

It is an essential element of defamation that the words complained of should be published

of the plaintiff. Where he is not named the test of this is whether the words would

reasonably lead people acquainted with him to the conclusion that he was the person

referred to

As revealed before the trial court the statement referred to as defamatory against the Appellant

was made by the Respondent at a meeting of the Pradeshiya Sabha held at its auditorium attended

by its members. During the trial before the District Court, in addition to the News Paper referred to

above, minutes of the Lankapura Pradeshiya Sabha dated 31.01.2005 was produced marked P-1. In

the said minute, at page 6 the statement said to have made by the Respondent was recorded as

follows;

When going through the said minute it appears that, what was reported in the News Paper was the

correct proceeding of the Lankapura Pradeshiya Sabha taken place on 31.01.2005. However as

7 transpired before us, the Plaintiff in the District Court proceedings (the Appellant before us) has

decided not to proceed against the News Paper which published the said news item, but decided to

proceed against the maker of the said statement. As further transpired, the Petitioner got to know

about the said statement when it was reported in the News Paper but, the Appellant whilst giving

evidence before the trial court had further said that the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha had

telephoned her and asked whether she is not ashamed to accept money from both sides. The said

statement made by the witness clearly indicates that the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha had

taken note of the statement made by the Respondent and confronted the same with the

Petitioner.

When considering the matters referred to above this court is satisfied that the statement said to

have made by the Respondent had been published within the meaning of the term Publication.

However as observed by the Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal as well as by the

District Judge, Polonnaruwa, the most important matter to be resolved is to consider whether the

said publication comes within privilege communication or not.

The possible defences in a case of this nature was discussed by Lord Uthwatt of the Privy

Council in the Privy Council decision of M.G. Perera Vs, A.V. Peiris 50 NLR at page 159, as follows;

Their Lordships attention has not been drawn to any case under the Roman Dutch Law or

the common law which exactly covers the point at issue. Both systems accord privilege to

fair reports of judicial proceedings and of proceedings in the nature of judicial proceedings

and to fair reports of parliamentary proceedings, and much time might be spent in an

inquiry whether the proceedings before the Commissioner fell within one or other of these

categories. Their Lordships do not propose to enter upon that inquiry. They prefer to relate

8

their conclusions to the wide general principle which underlies the defence of privilege in all

its aspects rather than to debate the question whether the case falls within some specific

category.

The wide general principle was stated by their Lordships in Macintosh V. Dun1 to be the

common convenience and welfare of society or the general interest of society and

other statements to much the same effect are to be found in Stuart V. Bell2 and in earlier

cases, most of which will be found collected in Mr. Spencer Bowers Valuable work on

Actionable Defamation. In the case of reports of judicial and parliamentary proceedings the

basis of the privilege is not the circumstance that the proceedings reported are judicial or

parliamentary-viewed as isolated facts- but that it is in the public interest that all such

proceedings should be fairly reported. As regards reports of judicial proceedings reference

may be made to Rex V. Wright3 where the basis of the privilege is expressed to be the

general advantage to the country in having these proceedings made public, and to Davison

V. Duncan4 where the phrase used is the balance of public benefit from publicity; while in

Wason V. Walter5 the privilege accorded to fair reported of parliamentary proceedings was

on the same basis as the privilege accorded to fair reports of judicial proceedings- the

requirements of the public interest.

In the said decision Lord Uthwatt had further observed, the importance of malice in relevant

publication as follows;

As regard the News Paper the Report was sent to it by the authorities in the ordinary

course. Nothing turns on any implied request to publishthat would in their Lordships

opinion be relevant only if malice were in issue.

9 When going through the facts of the case in hand as discussed above and the evidence given by the

Respondent before the trial court it appears that the Respondent was summoned before the

monthly meeting by the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha and questioned him with regard to the

recovery of arrears money and steps taken to recover those monies. When the Respondent

explained the steps taken, it was transpired that the services of a new Attorney at Law was

obtained by the Respondent in order to send letters of demand to the respective tenants and the

Respondent had justified his decision to retain a new Attorney at Law of his choice without

obtaining the prior approval of the Pradeshiya Sabha by making the statement in question.

As observed earlier in this judgment the Petitioner has decided not to prosecute the News Paper

which published the news item but decided to prosecute the maker of the statement. When

considering the circumstances under which the Respondent had made the above statement, it is

important to consider whether the said statement was made strictly within his employment and

therefore his statement comes within a privilege statement.

In this regard, it is also important to consider the facts transpired before the District Court from the

evidence by both parties.

The Appellant whilst giving evidence, had denied the fact that she appeared for an accused person

in a case filed by the Pradeshiya Sabha and produced the certified proceedings of the case in

question namely Magistrates Court, Polonnaruwa case No 98660 as P-1. According to the evidence

of the Appellant, the case was called on a motion filed by Nalaka Bandara Attorney at law on

17.12.2004. Since the accused Renuka Jayasuriya of Ideal Pharmacy produced the payment receipt,

the Appellant who represented the Pradeshiya Sabha admitted the payment and the accused was

discharged accordingly by court. The said fact was confirmed by Nalaka Bandara AAL when he was

called as a witness for the Plaintiff.

10 Upali Chandrawansa the Respondent when giving evidence before the District Court whilst

challenging the above position had confirmed the fact that the Petitioner appeared for an accused

person in the Magistrates Court as follows;

As referred to in the said evidence the Respondent had seen one Ms. Jayasuriya giving some money

to the Appellant and in support of his version he had submitted an affidavit from the said Renuka

Jayasuriya as well.

11 However under cross examination this witnesss credibility was challenged and at one stage

witness had to admit that he was in a different court house on that day and some of the answers

were given by going through the proceedings of that day.

Some of the important questions put to the Respondent and answers given by him are referred to

as follows;

An affidavit and a letter said to have prepared by one Renuka Jayasuriya had been produced

marked -5 and -6 respectively during the trial in the District Court. Even though several

objections were raised with regard to the admissibility of the said affidavit, I dont think it is

necessary to consider them at this juncture, since the document itself is contradictory to the

testimony of witness Renuka Jayasuriya. In her affidavit affirmed on 12.07.2005 and the letter

dated 26.03.2005 addressed to the Chairman Lankapura Pradeshiya Sabha, she had taken up the

position that she paid Rs. 300/ to the Petitioner in order to withdraw the case filed against her.

However whilst giving evidence on behalf of the Respondent the witness had explained as to what

happened in the Magistrates Court, when her evidence being led by the counsel on behalf of the

Respondent as follows;

14 When considering the above evidence with the two documents referred to above, the affidavit and

the letter produced marked -5 and -6 respectively, it is clear that the Respondent had made

an attempt to introduce some evidence in support of his version. The said attempt by him clearly

indicates his intention to mislead the court to cover up his position which appears to be untrue.

The said conduct of the Respondent indicates the fact that the Respondent when making the

statement in question had acted in malice against the Petitioner.

In the case of David V. Bell 16 NLR 319 it was held that,

In the case of defamation malice in modern English Law is no more than the absence of just

cause or excuse and similarly an actual intention or desire to injuria is not under the Roman

Dutch Law necessary to continue the animus injuriandi. Rackless or careless statements may

be taken as proof of animus injuriandi and while English Law malice can only be refuted by

showing the occasion was privileged or that the words were no more than honest and fair

expression of opinion or matters of public interest and general concern, the Roman Dutch

Law allows proof not only of such circumstances that the occasion was privileged but of any

other circumstances that furnish a reasonable excuse for the use of words explained of

The position taken up by the Respondent when he was subject to cross examination and the

evidence of witness Jayasuriya clearly establish that the statement referred to was made not only

with malicious intent towards the Appellant but was also made recklessly.

In the said circumstances I observe that the Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court err in law when

they conclude that the statement made by the Respondent was a privilege statement since it was

made at the monthly meeting to some questions raised from him within the four walls of the

committee hall, even though it was found to be a untrue statement.

15 The Petitioner whilst testifying before the District Court had explained the embarrassment she had

to undergo when the statement was made by the Respondent at the meeting as well as it was later

published in the News Paper. The above evidence was sufficiently considered by the trial judge in

her order when granting compensation.

It is further revealed that the said Pradeshiya Sabha had promptly taken steps with regard to the

complaint made by the Respondent to the effect that the Petitioner had appeared in a case filed by

the Pradeshiya Sabha against the interest of the Pradeshiya Sabha and taken steps to remove her

from the work assigned to her.

The above position clearly shows that the statement made by the Respondent was considered by

the Lankapura Pradeshiya Sabha as a statement made by the Respondent in his official capacity as

the revenue administration of the said Pradeshiya Sabha and decided to act upon the said

statement.

When considering whether the statement made by the Respondent was defamatory on the

Appellant the Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeal had further observed that there wasnt

sufficient material before the District Court to conclude that the said statement was made with

malice or with the intent of defaming her or with the intent of putting her in difficulty.

In this regard the Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeal have referred to the decision of Pittard V.

Oliver (1981) 60 L.J.Q.B. 219 where it was observed that an answer given to a quarry made by the

members of a Local Authority does not amount to defamation on a third party but as observed by

me, the matters elicited before the District Court had clearly indicated that the Respondent had

made the said statement with the intention of harming the Petitioner and the necessary animus

injuriandi was present in the case in hand.

16 In the case of Dahanayake V. Jayasekara 5 NLR 257 it was held that the Plaintiff in a defamation

case must be given the opportunity to establish that the alleged statement was untrue and that it

was made with improper motive.

Considering all the matters referred to above, I answer the questions of Law raise before this court

in favour of the Petitioner and allow the appeal before us. I therefore make order setting aside the

judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal of the North Central Province dated

14.12.2011 in Appeal Case No. NCP/HCCA/ARP/878/2010 and affirm the judgment of the District

Judge of Polonnaruwa in case No. 10645/Damages/2005, dated 18.10.2010.

However, I make no order with regard to cost.

Appeal allowed no costs.
