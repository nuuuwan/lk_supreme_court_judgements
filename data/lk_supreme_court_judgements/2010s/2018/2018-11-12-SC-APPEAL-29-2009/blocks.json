The plaintiff\u2019s case was that, in consideration of monies paid by the plaintiff to the defendant, the defendant had transferred the aforesaid half share to her by a Conditional Transfer No. 36014 dated 19th June 1979 subject to the agreement stated therein that, if the defendant repays a sum of Rs.9,200/- to the plaintiff on or before 19th June 1981, the plaintiff shall re-transfer the half share to the defendant. It was also agreed in the Conditional Transfer that the plaintiff will have absolute title to the half share from 20th June 1981 onwards if the defendant failed to pay this sum of Rs.9,200/- to the plaintiff on or before 19th June 1981. The defendant had failed to pay the sum of Rs.9200/- to the plaintiff on or before 19th June 1981 and, therefore, the plaintiff has absolute title to the half share in the paddy field. The plaintiff also averred that the defendant had made an application to the Debt Conciliation Board seeking to effect a settlement of the aforesaid debt owed by him to the plaintiff. A settlement had been entered in the Debt Conciliation Board in terms of which the defendant undertook to pay the debt in three instalments. However, the defendant had failed to pay these monies.",

Similarly, Bindra [Interpretation of Statutes 7th ed. at p.1087] states the word \u201cmay\u201d is \u201cprima facie enabling and permissive.\u201d.

Generally when coupled with a duty it is construed as obligatory.\u201d. Venkataramana Rao J cited the well-known words of Lord Cairns CJ in JULIUS vs. LORD BISHOP OF OXFORD [1880 5 AC 214 at p.222] that when words such as \u201cmay\u201d and \u201cit shall be lawful\u201d are used in a statute \u201cThey are words merely making that legal and possible which there would otherwise be no right or authority to do.

In this connection, Bindra cites SUDHIRA BALA ROY vs. STATE OF WEST BENGAL [AIR 1981 Cal. 130 at p 135] where Dutt J stated \u201cNormally the word `may\u2019 used in a statute should be construed as discretionary, but in the context of the statutory provision in which the word finds place, it may become necessary to interpret it as mandatory \u2026..\u201d.",

Further, in STATE OF U.P. vs. JOGENDRA SINGH [AIR 1963 SC 1618 at p.1620] Gajendragadkar J stated \u201cThere is no doubt that the word `may\u2019 generally does not mean `must\u2019 or `shall\u2019. But it is well settled that the word `may\u2019 is capable of meaning `must\u2019 or `shall\u2019 in the light of the context.

However, Fernando CJ observed [at p. 221] that the earlier decision in SAMARASINGHE vs. BALASURIYA appeared to have been reached because the creditor had, contrary to the restriction specified by section 40 (1), sued to recover the original amount of the debt and not the sum which was stated in the settlement before the Debt Conciliation Board.",

With much respect, it seems to me that the Court would not have reached that opinion, if the circumstances of that case had required full consideration of the terms of s. 40 (1) of Chapter 81. The language of the section, in particular, of its Proviso, shows that the creditor\u2019s former right under the mortgage, i.e. the right of hypothec as distinct from the right to receive payment of the debt, continue to subsist under the settlement, even though the settlement may not expressly so provide.

Since the debtor failed to pay the debt in terms of the settlement, the creditor claimed that title had passed to him under the conditional transfer and instituted a vindicatory action claiming a declaration of title to the land. The defendant debtor took up a defence that section 43 of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance debarred the plaintiff creditor from maintaining a vindicatory action on the basis that the only remedy available to the plaintiff creditor was to make an application under section 43.
