Aluwihare PC. J.,

The Petitioner has complained to this court that her fundamental right to equality

guaranteed by Article 12 (1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka has been infringed by the

1st Respondent by refusing admission of her daughter Aksha Arundathi to Grade 01 of

Girls High School, Kandy.

The Petitioner in her application has averred that she was born on 30. 01. 1979 and

baptized as a Christian on 31. 10. 1993 in Badulla and her daughter, born on 10. 02.

2012 was baptized on 08. 07. 2012. Copies of the daughters birth certificate and

Certificate of Baptism are marked P3 and P4 respectively.

In June 2017, the Petitioner submitted a school admission application dated 10. 06. 2017

for the admission of her daughter to Grade I in Girls High School, Kandy for the year

2018 under the quota allocated to Christian students. The Petitioner has attached along

with the application, inter alia, a letter from Rev. M.G. Edmund J.P., Superintendent

Minister, Methodist Church, Kandy and a Grama Niladhari certificate confirming the

Residence and character. These documents are attached P7 and P8 respectively.

Thereafter, by letter dated 24.07. 2017, the 1st Respondent informed the Petitioner to be

present for an interview on 07. 09. 2017 at 2 pm and to bring the originals and

photocopies of all documents submitted.

When they duly presented themselves for the interview, the 1st Respondent has asked the

Petitioner for the Deed of her residence. Upon informing that the Petitioner does not have

the deed as they are not the owners of the property, the 1st Respondent has promptly

asked them to leave.

Thereafter, the Petitioner together with aforesaid Rev. M.G. Edumund have appealed to

the 1st Respondent drawing her attention to clause 3.2 of the Instructions issued by the

Ministry of Education regarding the admission of Children to Grade one in Government

Schools for the year 2018 (marked P5). Clause 3.2 of the said document specifies that

in filling vacancies in schools vested to the government under Assisted Schools and

Training schools (special provisions) Act No. 05 of 1960 and Assisted Schools and

Training schools (Supplementary provisions) Act No. 08 of 1961, the proportion of

children belonging to different religions at the time of vesting the school to the

government will be taken into consideration and the number of vacancies in the said

school shall be accordingly divided among different religions and the categories.

Pursuant to the said appeal, the 1st Respondent informed the Petitioner to be present

before the Appeals Board on 14. 11. 2017. At the Appeal hearing too, the Petitioner was

asked to produce the deed to their residence and the Petitioner informed the Board that

they do not have a deed as their place of residence is owned by the husbands unmarried

brother. In its place, they produced additional documents confirming their residence

namely the Grama Niladhari Certificate and provided proof that their names have been

registered in the Electoral register. The Appeal Board at the end of the hearing awarded

them a total of 20 marks (marked P13) and informed that the final list will be posted on

10. 12. 2017. However, the Petitioners state that their daughters name was not included

in the list.

The Petitioner claims that the non-admission of her daughter to Grade 01 of High School

Kandy is violative of Article 12 as the 1st Respondent failed to give regard to clause 3.2 of

the P5 which states that due consideration should be given to the proportion of children

belonging to different religions at the time of vesting the school to the government. She

further states that, at the time of vesting to the Government, Girls High School Kandy

had 968 students from which 373 students were Christians. Accordingly, the admission

4

for Year 2018 has to maintain a proportion of 38.53% of Christian students which would

amount to 75 students. She alleges that since the required quota has not been achieved

for the Year 2018, her daughter should be admitted to the school as of right on the basis

of her religion.

The 1st Respondent in her objections has expressed doubts about the religion of the

Applicant on the premise that the Grama Niladhari certificate bears an alteration in

relation to the Petitioners religion and that the Certificate of Baptism bears 2017 as the

year of issuance. She further claims that in terms of the Circular no. 22/2017 (marked

R1), applicants who apply under the proximity/vicinity category must establish their

residence by resorting to the specific documents specified therein and that anyone who

is unable to support the claim of residence in this manner is liable to have the application

rejected. She also states that, in any event, the School has met the respective quota for the

year 2018 and that the Petitioners daughter, notwithstanding the failure to prove the

residence, cannot be admitted.

For the present purposes, it is important to first determine the percentage which the

school must maintain under clause 4.2 of the Circular No. 22/2017 and clause 3.2 of

the Instructions regarding the admission of Children to Grade one in Government

Schools for the year 2018 [hereinafter Instructions]which is the identical English

reproduction of the aforesaid clause 4.2. In order to ascertain the proportions of

students, I refer to the document marked P14 submitted by the Petitioner, and relied on

by the Respondentwhich is a report of the proceedings of the Methodist Church Synod

held in 1961. According to this report, in 1961, there had been 968 students learning at

Girls High School of which 373 students belonged to the Christian faith. These 373

students were further sub-categorized into Methodists and students belonging to other

denominations. Thus, at the point of vesting, Girls High School, Kandy housed 81

Methodist students from a total of 968. This reflects an approximate percentage of 8.36

which the school has maintained under clause 4.2 of the Circular No. 22/2017 over the

years.

The 1st Respondent has brought to the attention of this Court the numbers relevant for

the year 2018. The total number of vacancies for Grade I, 2018 were 190 out of which

5

25 seats had to be reserved for children of those in the armed forced who served in

operational areas. This left 165 seats to be allocated among the different categories of

admission. According to the 1st Respondent, 50% of the said 165 was allocated to the

proximity category, which amounts to 83 seats. It is from the said 50% that a further

8.36% had to be reserved for Methodist childrenwhich constituted 7 seats. The 1st

Respondent has informed this Court that already 12 Methodist students have been

admitted.

The Petitioner argues that clause 3.2 of the Instructions, which is identical to clause 4.2

of the Circular no. 22/2017, permits when there are no applicants from a religion or

when the number of applications from a religion is less than the number of vacancies set

apart for that religion, such applicants will all be admitted and the remaining vacancies

shall then (and only then) be proportionately divided among other religions [emphasis

added by the Petitioner]

However contrary to what is claimed by the Petitioner, clause 3.2 imposes no such

mandatory requirement on the school administrators to admit all applicants based on

their religion to fill the vacancies. It only stipulates that;

In filling vacancies in schools vested to the government under Assisted

Schools and Training schools (special provisions) Act No. 05 of 1960 and

Assisted Schools and Training schools (Supplementary provisions) Act No. 08

of 1961, the proportion of children belonging to different religions at the

time of vesting the school to the government will be taken into consideration

and the number of vacancies in the said school shall be accordingly divided

among different religions and the categories. When the number of

applications is less than the number of vacancies set apart for a given

category of a religion, remaining vacancies shall be proportionately divided

among other categories of the same religion. When there are no applicants

from a religion or when the number of applications from a religion is less

than the number of vacancies set apart for that religion, such applicants will

all be admitted and the remaining vacancies shall then (and only then) be

proportionately divided among other religions

6

The Petitioners argument proceeds on the basic premise that for the purposes of clause

3.2, the School must allocate the vacancies taking Christianity as the only basis and not

its different denominations. However, as stated, the School has allocated seats giving due

recognition to this distinction. This distinction is also reflected in P14the document

relied on by the Petitioner. For the year 2018, the 1st Respondent has already admitted 12

students although the allocated number of seats were only 7. As to how the 1st Respondent

admitted 5 students in excess of the quota reserved for the proximity category has not

been explained by the 1st Respondent. Nevertheless, that alone cannot compel this Court

to make a finding that the school has proceeded on the basis of Christianity and not on

the denominations. The excess of 5 seats could also have been the result of residual seats

being proportionately divided among the categories due to lack of applicants in some

other category. Since there is no evidence nor any allegation disputing that the 1st

Respondent has adopted an inaccurate classification, I am of the view that the School

allocation of seats to Methodist students for 2018 is correct. Consequently, this means

that the Girls High School, Kandy, by admitting 12 Methodist students under the

proximity category (for reasons undisclosed and unchallenged) has already exceeded the

quota for that category for the relevant year.

Also implicit in the Petitioners argument is the contention that, even if a Methodist

applicant (or an applicant belonging to other faith) fails to meet the criteria for

admission, they must be admitted solely on the basis of their religion if there are vacancies

remaining in a particular quota. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner has cited SC FR

335/2016 where it was held that Anyhow when a Christian child has applied to be

admitted to Kingswood College, Kandy under any category, if the documents show that

he is a Christian and if the number of Christian children already admitted are not above

the allowed percentage of 20% intake under the religion category, then that child has a

right to be admitted under clause 3.2 of the circular.

However, it is important to note that in the said case, the issue pertaining to proof of

residence was resolved in favor of the Petitioner. Furthermore, the Respondent in that

case had admitted only 1 child under the proximity category. In view of the said factual

matrix, it cannot be said that the said judgment confers on an applicant the right to gain

admission to a school solely based on the religion, irrespective of their ineligibility. That

7

would amount to a surreptitious by-passing of the procedure. At the very least, there

must be evidence on the record to show that the applicant fulfills the bare minimum

qualifications for the admission.

The Circular no. 22/2017 proceeds taking certain predetermined categories of

applicants as its basis. These categories are clearly spelled out in the circular along with

the respective qualifications. A candidate must prefer his or her application under one of

these categories to gain admission. If religion was to be the sole criteria for eligibility, the

circular could have made it a separate category. The fact that it isnt, means that religion

must be viewed within the framework of the overarching eligibility criteria. The religious

quota is a special factor for considerationand not a separate tier of admission. It does

not make eligible an otherwise ineligible applicant. This is the reason for proportionately

dividing remaining slots apportioned to a religion among other categoriesto facilitate

the intake of eligible candidates in other categories.

Thus, the issue we must in fact determine is whether the Petitioner in the present instance

has established their proof of residence and the fact of Baptism.

Although the 1st Respondent disputes the certificate of Baptism, I am not inclined to

believe that the certificate is not genuine and by extension that the Petitioners daughter

is not a Christian. The Respondent has not disputed the fact that it was issued in 2017,

and for the particular purpose of preferring the School admission application. The

Petitioner has also produced letters and interventions made by Rev. M.G. Edmund J.P.,

Superintendent Minister, Methodist Church, Kandy on behalf of the Petitioners in

relation to the school admission. In those circumstances, I see no reason to disbelieve that

the Petitioners daughter was baptized as a Christian.

However, by their own admission, the Petitioners are not the owners of the residence. In

terms of the circular therefore, they would be not be entitled to receive most amount of

marks given to different types of documents through which an applicant is called to prove

residence. These marks are given based on the strength of proofthe highest being given

to a title deed and the lowest being given to other documents such as the National Identity

Card, Water Bills, Birth certificates etc. This last category is not exhaustive and I would

8

state that, where the circumstances so warrant, they could include a Grama Niladhari

certificate.

As correctly contended by the counsel for Petitioner, the lack of a title deed does not

empower the 1st Respondent to outright reject the Petitioners application at the

interview. A rejection could only take place if the applicant has not produced an iota of

evidence supporting their claim. In the present case, the Petitioner has presented a Grama

Niladhari certificate to support their claim for residence. Albeit very low, that document

was entitled to receive a set mark on par with Telephone bills and other similar

documents. In those circumstances, the 1st Respondent was wrong to reject their

application simply because the Petitioner did not have a title deed.

Nevertheless, I observe that due consideration was given to these factors at the appeal

stage. The Appeal Board has awarded the Petitioner 02 marks under the heading

, indicating that the Grama Niladhari certificate was

admitted as a valid document supporting the claim of residence. This establishes that the

Petitioner resides within the Administrative district of Kandy.

Thus, there is evidence to support that the Petitioners daughter fulfils the bare minimum

qualifications for admission. The next question is therefore to see whether there is room

to accommodate the Petitioners daughters application. As admitted by both parties, the

Petitioners application has only succeeded in obtaining 20 marks. No doubt, this would

place their application at a clear disadvantage. However, by virtue of clause 4.2 of

Circular No. 22/2017, this disadvantage could be overcome if there are seats remaining

in the Methodist quota. Even if there are seats remaining, preference must undoubtedly

be given to those who have obtained higher marks in the same proximate cum religious

category. It is subject to these considerations, could the 1st Respondent consider the

admission of the Petitioners daughter.

However, we are informed that the School has already exceeded the relevant quota for

Methodist students under the proximate category. Therefore, the Petitioners daughter

could only be admitted, subject to the above specified conditions, if there are residual

seats in the other 4 categories which, in terms of the Circular, ought to be proportionately

divided among the remaining categories. There is no material before us to determine

9

whether any such seats were left vacant in other categories. However, the 1st Respondent

has informed this Court that 13 Methodist students in total have been admitted to Grade

I for the year 2018. This corresponds to the aforesaid 8.36% percentage which the School

has maintained under clause 4.2 of the Circular No. 22/2017. It appears therefore that

there is no room to accommodate the Petitioners daughters application, in the facts and

circumstances of the Petitioners case.

Where an equal protection claim is advanced, an intentional and purposeful

discrimination must be shown by any person protesting discrimination in the

administration of the law. In Wijesinghe v Attorney General [1978-79-80] 1 SLR 102

His Lordship Justice Wanasundera with whom Justice Sharvananda and Justice Ismail

agreed, quoting Stone CJ.s dictum in Snowden v Hughes, held that:

The Constitution does not assure uniformity of decisions or immunity

from merely erroneous action, whether by the Courts or the executive

agencies of a State. The judicial decision must of necessity depend on the

facts and circumstances of each particular case and what may

superficially appear to be an unequal application of the law may not

necessarily amount to a denial of equal protection of law unless there is

shown to be present in it an element of intentional and purposeful

discrimination.

In the present case, the School has conducted their admission process based on the

proportion of children belonging to different denominations that existed at the time of

vesting the school to the government, as reflected in P14. The Court cannot necessarily

fault them for adopting the said criterion since it is not repugnant to the statutory

requirements. The Respondent has also drawn attention to the fact that they have been

unable to admit two other candidates, despite them securing 45 marks and 74 marks, as

the relevant quota for that year has been filled. Where this is the case, I cannot conclude

that the Respondents acted with an insidious discriminatory purpose when they refused

to admit the Petitioners daughter. Every similarly circumstanced candidate in the non-

Roman Catholic category has been treated in the similar manner.

10

Therefore, having considered the facts and circumstances in this case, I hold that the

Petitioner has failed to establish that 1st Respondent has violated her right guaranteed

under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

Accordingly, this Application is dismissed.
