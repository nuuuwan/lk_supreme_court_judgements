ARGUED ON: 12.01.2018

DECIDED ON: 09. 11.2018

Aluwihare, PC. J.,

The 1st Accused-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Accused-Appellant) had been indicted along with two others on the following

counts:

That on or about the 12th September, 2012 the accused-appellant along with the

2nd and 3rd accused;

1. Committed the offence of Rape on Solamalai Uma-Devi an offence

punishable under section 364 (2) (g) of the Penal Code, as amended,

the offence of “gang rape”.

4

2. Committed the offence of Robbery in respect of a gold chain that was in the

possession of aforesaid Solamalai Uma-Devi, an offence punishable under

Section 380 of the Penal Code.

3. Committed the offence of murder, by causing the death of Solamalai Uma-

Devi, an offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

One of the Accused (2nd Accused) had passed away even prior to the

commencement of the trial; accordingly, the trial at the High Court only proceeded

against the Accused-Appellant and the 3rd Accused.

At the conclusion of the trial the learned High Court Judge convicted both the

Accused-Appellant, and the 3rd Accused, on all charges.

The Court of Appeal after hearing the appeal of the Accused-Appellant, and the 3rd

Accused, dismissed the same. Aggrieved by the judgment of the Court of Appeal,

the Accused-Appellant sought special leave to appeal and special leave was granted

on the following questions of law:

(i) Did the learned High Court Judge as well as the learned Judges of the

Court of Appeal fail to consider that the evidence given by the witness

Kandiah Vasudevan about the alleged statement made to the Petitioner

by the 2nd Accused was belated and made at the instance of the Police.

(ii) Did the learned High Court Judge as well as the learned Judges of the

Court of Appeal fail to consider that the alleged statement made by the

5

2nd accused which implicates the Petitioner as well is inadmissible in

view of Section 30 of the Evidence Ordinance.

(iii) Did the learned High Court Judge as well as the learned Judges of the

Court of Appeal misdirect themselves when they took into

consideration the fact that the Petitioner was present with the 2nd

accused when the 2nd accused pawned a gold chain allegedly

belonging to the deceased as an item of evidence against the Petitioner.

(iv) Did the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal misdirect themselves

when the conviction against the Petitioner in respect of the charge of

rape was affirmed inasmuch as there was no evidence as regards the

commission of gang rape or any involvement in the act of rape by the

Petitioner?

The above questions of law are referred to in sub paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (g)

of paragraph 18 of the Petition of the Petitioner of the present application.

Before I consider the facts of the case and the legal issues raised in this appeal, it

should be borne in mind that the prosecution relied entirely on circumstantial

evidence to establish the charges, for the reason that there were no eyewitnesses to

substantiate any of the charges against the Accused-Appellant. Thus, it was

incumbent on the prosecution to establish that the ‘circumstances’ the prosecution

6

relied on, are consistent only with the guilt of the accused-appellant and not with

any other hypothesis.

Regard should be had to a set of principles and rules of prudence, developed in a

series of English decisions, which are now regarded as settled law by our courts.

The two basic principles are-

(i) The inference sought to be drawn must be consistent with all the proved

facts, if it is not, then the inference cannot be drawn.

(ii) The proved facts should be such that they exclude every reasonable

inference from them, save the one to be drawn. If they do not exclude

other reasonable inferences, then there must be a doubt whether the

inference sought to be drawn is correct (per Watermeyer J. in R vs. Blom

1939 A.D. 188)

The rule regarding the exclusion of every hypothesis of innocence before drawing

the inference of guilt was laid down way back in 1838 in the case of R vs. Hodges

(1838 2 Lew. cc.227). The circumstances must be such as to produce moral

certainty to the exclusion of every reasonable doubt.

It would be pertinent to mention here that a trial judge or for that matter a judge

sitting in appeal, must necessarily consider the evidence (circumstances) guided

by the principle referred to above.

Before I embark on discussing the facts of this case, I also wish to make specific

reference to Rule 4 of the five Rules in evaluating circumstantial evidence, laid

7

down by E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his monumental work “The Law of Evidence”

(Vol. Page 24).

“Rule 4”: The chain or strand of proved facts and circumstances must be

so complete that no link in it is missing. If any vital factor which is

necessary to make the chain or strand complete is missing or has remained

unproved, it must be held that the prosecution has failed to establish its

case. A vital link should never be inferred.

I shall now set about narrating the factual background to the charges.

Witness Pushpalatha had testified to the effect that she saw her sister Uma-Devi

alive for the last time on 12.9.2001 when she left home around 8.00 to attend a

class where she was learning typing. Although she had not returned home that

day; no one, however, appeared to have panicked as the deceased Uma-Devi had

said that she had to attend a wedding. On the following day, when she did not

return home, their father Alagan lodged a complaint with the police about his

missing daughter.

Anusha Ariyasena, who was attending the same vocational training, had stated in

her evidence that on 12.09.2001 Uma-Devi did attend the class. Both of them had

walked back to the bus terminal and they had parted ways. The evidence is that

Uma- Devi used to trek the distance from home to the class on foot, a distance of

about two kilometres.

8

On the day following around 2.30 in the afternoon, witness Jayasundera who had

gone to the thicket by the Mallanda bridge, had accidentally come across the dead

body of Uma-Devi. The police had been summoned to the scene and the

investigations had commenced.

As far as the persons responsible for this heinous crime were concerned, the

investigations led virtually to nothing. After the post mortem, the Judicial Medical

Officer opined the death had resulted from manual strangulation. The Judicial

Medical Officer had observed a number of minor injuries on the body. Two bite

marks, two nail marks, a laceration of an ear lobe and an abrasion of the neck, two

other injuries had been observed near the genital area and anus. Undoubtedly,

these are injuries that clearly establishes that Uma-Devi had been ravished, before

she was strangled to death. The laceration of the ear and the abrasion marks on

the neck are indications of forcible removal of jewellery Uma-Devi was wearing.

Police were not successful in making a breakthrough for one whole year. A year

later somewhere in November 2002, witness Kandiah Vasudevan made a

statement to the police with regard to the murder of Uma-Devi and the

investigations recommenced.

The most crucial evidence in this case emanates from Kandiah Vasudevan. Due to

the inherent weaknesses of his testimony which I shall advert to later, close

scrutiny not only of his testimony but also of his credibility is critical. At this point,

however, I will only refer to his testimony.

9

According to his evidence, Vasudevan was eleven years when he was first

employed by the accused-appellant in his grocery store. After working there for 2

years, Vasudevan joined the deceased 2nd accused, Salam, in his fruit stall, which

also had been located at a distance not far from the grocery of the accused-

appellant.

Vasudevan had said that Uma-Devi was known to him as she used to visit the

grocery of the accused-appellant on the way to her classes. In answer to a question

whether she (Uma-Devi) came alone, the witness had said, she comes with her

small brother. He had come to know of the tragedy that had befallen Uma-Devi

and had gone near the location where her body was, but not near enough to see

the body.

The witness had further stated that two or three days after the body of Uma-Devi

was located, he overheard a conversation between the deceased 2nd accused

Salam, and the accused-appellant.

The conversation, as heard by Vasudevan in Vasudevan’s own words is as follows:

" සලාම් කිව්වා, අපි දෙන්නා මැරුවා කියා කවුරුවත් ෙන්දන් නැහැ. දෙළොලි ගිදයාත්

හාරීස් යන්න එො ".

According to Vasudevan the utterance had been made by the deceased 2nd accused

to the accused-appellant. At this point the prosecution had posed a question:

"කවුෙ මැරුවා කීදව් "?

10

To which witness Vasudevan had responded by stating “උමා දේවි ”.

In my view, this question is clearly a leading question, as it suggests that the name

of the deceased was referred to by the 2nd accused in the course of the alleged

conversation.

Thus, the learned High Court Judge ought not to have allowed this question to be

asked as it relates not to a peripheral matter, but to a matter that goes to the very

root of the case. In the interest of justice, no witness should be prompted to say

what the prosecution wants the witness to state; especially regarding issues that

are critical. This is especially so, as Vasudevan’s testimony is infirm because it is

belated and also due to the fact that his relationship with the accused appellant

had soured by that time.

Vasudevan’s position was that due to fear, he did not divulge the conversation he

purported to have overheard and had kept it to himself for more than a year and

decided to divulge it, after he found employment on a farm, which was in the same

area (Nawalapitiya). He left the employment of Haaris (the accused-appellant) on

an unpleasant note as the accused-appellant had refused to increase his salary.

The other witness who purported to connect the deceased 2nd accused to the

incident, is Sundaralingam, a businessman in Nawalapitiya who ran a textile shop

and a pawn broking business. According to Sundaralingam, both the accused-

appellant and the deceased 2nd accused (Salam) had been known to him and they

had on numerous occasions come to him to pawn jewellery and to borrow money

and subsequently had redeemed those articles as well. His evidence was that the

11

deceased 2nd accused had come to his textile shop on a date in September, 2001

in the company of the 1st accused-appellant and had pawned a chain (necklace).

The prosecution also had led evidence of witness Nilusha Herath, who said she

lived in Mallanda Nawalapitiya and that the road leading to her house is somewhat

densely populated. The 3rd accused was the caretaker of the building close to her

house, which was used for slaughtering poultry. She had said that on a day in

September, 2001, she heard the noise of someone wailing which had lasted for an

instant, but could not say whether it was that of a man or a woman. Although this

witness had come out of her house on hearing the noise, she had not seen anyone.

Ismail Mohamed Hanifa was the person who ran the poultry farm and the

slaughter house and had admitted that the 3rd accused was the caretaker of the

building that was used to slaughter birds and there were instances when more than

50 birds were slaughtered in a given day.

Chief Inspector De Silva, who conducted the investigations into this matter had

inspected the building used for slaughtering and having observed dry stains similar

to blood on the floor and on the walls, had obtained the substance that gave the

appearance of blood stains, onto cotton swabs and had referred them for analysis

to the Government Analyst. The witness from the Government analyst, Jayamanne

who testified with regard to the analysis stated that he identified human blood on

the specimens sent for analysis, but the condition of the specimens was not suitable

for grouping.

12

DIG Abeyrathne Bandara in his evidence, on being questioned by the learned State

Counsel, had said that the accused revealed information with regard to the

productions (the chain) that were recovered in the course of the investigations.

The above, appears to be the sum total of evidence led by the prosecution to

establish the charges.

Analysis of the evidence.

Before I analyse the evidence, I wish to reiterate the fact that the 2nd accused was

dead before the trial commenced and the 3rd accused whose conviction was

affirmed by the Court of appeal had not canvassed his conviction before the

Supreme Court. Thus, the issue this court is called upon to decide is the legality of

the judgment of the Court of Appeal in relation to the accused-appellant who stood

as the 1st accused before the High Court. I shall now deal with the questions of

law on which special leave was granted in this matter.

The first question was whether:

(1) the learned High Court Judge as well as the Court of Appeal failed to

consider that the evidence of Kandiah Vasudevan was belated and made at

the instance of the Police.

At the outset, it must be stated that apart from the bare suggestion that Vasudevan

gave evidence at the behest of the police, there is nothing to indicate that that was

the case and as such I have no hesitation in holding that it cannot be said that

13

Vasudevan’s evidence was at the behest of the Police. The witness, however, came

out with his story after more than a year had passed since the death of Uma-Devi

and sometime after he left the employment of the deceased 2nd accused. It is also

in evidence that he left the employment with the accused-appellant over a salary

issue. These are factors that accentuate the inherent weaknesses in Vasudevan’s

evidence. On the other hand, the witness was only a boy of 14 years when he

overheard the purported conversation, between the accused-appellant and the

deceased 2nd accused. In view of these factors, the infirmity in Vasudevan’s

evidence, resulting from belatedness dilutes to some extent. As such, having

observed the demeanour and deportment of the witness, if the learned trial Judge

had formed the view that Vasudevan was a credible witness, I do not think this

court can fault the trial judge for forming such an opinion.

However, both the High Court and the Court of Appeal have overlooked a

fundamental principle in evidence, that is, ‘evidence must be weighed and not

counted’. In this regard both the High Court as well as the Court of Appeal failed

to evaluate the testimony of witness Vasudevan but had taken it on its face value

which ought not to have been done in a case that is based purely on circumstantial

evidence.

The court is required to consider whether the items of evidence are consistent with

any other hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused. The Court of Appeal had

neither considered the issue of credibility of the witness nor the admissibility of the

statement purported to have been made by the deceased 2nd accused to the

14

accused-appellant, although both these issues had been raised before the Court of

Appeal as reflected in the judgment itself. Having considered the issue of

credibility of witness Vasudevan, I am of the view that the learned High Court

Judge cannot be faulted for treating Vasudevan as a credible witness. In fairness to

the learned High Court Judge, he had, to an extent considered the infirmities of

Vasudevan’s testimony before deciding to act on it. As such I answer the 1st

question of law on which Special Leave was granted in the negative.

The second question of law on which Special Leave was granted was on the issue

of admissibility of the purported statement made by the deceased 2nd accused to

the accused-appellant which witness Vasudevan supposed to have overheard.

This issue had been raised before the Court of Appeal but the judgment of their

Lordships does not appear to have considered this issue. There is only a passing

reference that the said question was raised as an issue on behalf of the 1st accused-

appellant.

At the hearing of this appeal the learned President’s Counsel on behalf of the

accused-appellant contended that this evidence is obnoxious to section 30 of the

Evidence Ordinance, and therefore inadmissible.

Section 30 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows: -

“When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same

offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself

15

and some other of such persons is proved, the court shall not take into

consideration such confession as against such other person.”

Illustration

A and B are jointly tried for murder of C. It is proved that A said “B and

I murdered C”. The court shall not consider the effect of this confession

as against B.

In the instant case the 2nd accused Salam was dead at the time the accused-

appellant was tried before the High Court. As such the admissibility of the

purported statement has to be considered under the evidentiary provisions relating

to “statements by persons who cannot be called as witnesses” and to be more

precise under section 32 of the Evidence Ordinance which deals with statements

made by a person who is dead.

Section 32 (3) of the Ordinance states: -

(3) When the statement is against the pecuniary or Proprietary interest

of the person making it or when if true, it would expose him or would

have exposed him to criminal prosecution or to a suit for damages.

(Emphasis added)

In terms of the aforesaid provision, the statement made by deceased 2nd Accused

Salam, to the Accused-appellant would be admissible under the provision, as the

statement if “true”, would have exposed Salam to a criminal prosecution.

16

The authority for this proposition is found in the case of King Vs. Ludowyke 37

NLR 129. In this case, the accused who was the Assistant Sweep Secretary of the

Galle Gymkhana Club was charged with Criminal Breach of Trust of monies

belonging to the Club. A clerk (since deceased) worked as an Assistant to the

accused. The clerk had made a statement to the Secretary of the Club, as well as to

the police having deposited the club money to the account of the accused at the

request of the accused. Dreiburg J admitted this statement under Section 32(3) of

the Evidence Ordinance because the statement would have exposed the clerk to a

criminal prosecution. A similar decision was taken in the case of Korossa Rubber

Co. Vs. Silva 21 NLR 73 at page 75.

This provision is one of the exemptions to the hearsay rule and the rationale for

admission of such statements appears to be that no person would implicate himself

(of a crime) unless it is true. Thus, even though the statement purported to have

been made by the deceased 2nd accused to the accused-appellant would not be

admissible under Section 30 of the Evidence Ordinance, its admissibility under

Section 32 (3) of the Ordinance cannot be denied.

As such I answer the 2nd question of law raised on behalf of the accused-appellant

also in the negative.

Having held so I am of the view that it would be remiss on my part, if I am to

overlook the evidentiary value that could be attached to the purported statement

made by the deceased 2nd accused. It is the sole item of evidence that would even

remotely connect the accused-appellant to this crime and in my view, it is

17

imperative that its evidentiary value should be tested to see whether it is consistent

with the irresistible inference of guilt that is required to convict the accused-

appellant.

It so appears that judges tend to gloss over facts and draw inferences whereas close

scrutiny of evidence is sine qua non in cases based on circumstantial evidence. I

find the Court of Appeal also had committed this cardinal error in the present case.

The court is not only required to decide whether the facts are consistent with the

hypothesis of the prisoner's guilt, but whether they are inconsistent with any other

reasonable hypothesis of his innocence (R Vs. Hodges supra) The circumstances

must be such as to produce moral certainty to the exclusion of every reasonable

doubt. I shall now consider the evidence of witness Vasudevan in the backdrop of

the aforesaid principles relating to circumstantial evidence referred to above.

It is common ground that Vasudevan made a statement to the police after more

than a year had elapsed since the incident. As such the accuracy of his memory

and the risk of forgetfulness come into issue. Vasudevan, a person belonging to

Tamil ethnicity gave evidence in Sinhala. Throughout his examination-in-chief

including the purported statement he said he overheard, Vasudevan testified in

Sinhala. His proficiency in the Sinhala language was not tested. In his own words,

this is what Vasudevan said that he overheard:

"සලාම් කිව්වා, අපි දෙන්නා මැරුවා කියා කවුරුවත් ෙන්දන් නැහැ. දෙළොලි ගිදයාත් හාරීස්

යන්න එො".

18

To which the accused-appellant had not responded, according to Vasudevan.

The fact remains witness Vasudevan had heard only a part of the conversation that

was taking place. According to him, he approached the accused-appellant’s

Grocery with the intention of getting some instructions from Salam. No sooner he

heard this utterance he says he turned back and went, as such court does not have

the benefit of ascertaining the context in which the statement was made.

Witness had not been asked what was the first word he heard when he approached

the grocery or whether he heard anything else after this utterance.

In cross examination, it transpired that the conversation between Salam and

accused-appellant had taken place in Tamil language and not in Sinhala. In the

course of the cross examination he came out with the Tamil words said to have

been used during this most crucial conversation. He translated on his own, the

words he thought he heard and said the same before the Court. It appears that

everybody, including the learned trial judge, has unquestioningly admitted that

the translation was accurate.

Even if the statement made by Salam is taken, at its face value, the question is,

whether the only irresistible inference that can be drawn from this conversation is

that both Salam and the accused-appellant committed the murder of Uma-Devi.

The prosecution’s case was that this murder was committed by three persons and

not two.

19

Thus, the issue is when Salam said “අපි දෙන්නා මැරුවා කියා කවුරුවත් ෙන්දන් නැහැ”

did he refer to

i. himself and the 3rd accused? ; or

ii. was it Salam and the accused-appellant? ; or

iii. could it have been Salam and some other person whose identity

was not known to the prosecution?

One may have an inkling that Salam referred to himself and the accused-appellant.

But without the knowledge of how the entire conversation between the two ensued

and the context in which the utterance was made, can one say with certainty that

the words “අපි දෙන්නා”, referred to none other than Salam and the accused-

appellant, when the prosecution’s own case was that three people were involved?

If Salam’s statement is to be acted upon, then the murder had been committed by

two persons and not three. The complicity of Salam is in no doubt. Then it has to

be either Salam and the accused appellant, or Salam and the 3rd accused who stand

convicted or it could even be Salam and a third person. Thus, the question arises

as to which two of the three persons indicted were responsible for the murder.

Salam, when he said “අපි දෙන්නා මැරුවා” did he refer to himself and the 3rd

accused who now stand convicted?

I also wish to state that the manner in which the prosecution has led evidence in

this case by the prosecution is not desirable. Vasudevan is a belated witness by a

considerable time gap and who had also had some displeasure with the accused-

appellant. In this context the prosecution ought to have allowed the witness to

20

testify freely without prompting or leading, so that the credibility of the witness

could have been properly evaluated. Immediately after witness Vasudevan had

referred to the purported conversation, the learned State Counsel had shot the

question “කවුෙ මැරුවා කීදව්?” Suggesting that the name of the deceased transpired

during the conversation which was not the case. The learned State Counsel should

never have asked this question and on the other hand ought not to have been

permitted by the learned High Court Judge as up to that point of his evidence,

Vasudevan had not referred to the identity of the dead person.

In response to this question Vasudevan answered “Uma-Devi”.

The manner of questioning not only diminishes the evidentiary value of the

testimony, but also tarnishes the testimonial trustworthiness of the witness, as one

could reasonably expect the witness to have come out with the name “Uma-Devi”

on his own, if that name was referred to in the conversation between Salam and

the accused-appellant.

For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that it is difficult to conclude with

certainty that the use of the word “අපි” in the purported conversation, is an

exclusive reference to Salam and the accused-appellant. As such, that evidence

cannot be used as an item of incriminating evidence against the accused-appellant.

The 3rd question of law, on which leave was granted was: as to whether both the

learned High Court Judge and the Court of Appeal misdirected themselves in taking

into consideration an item of incriminating evidence; namely, that the accused-

21

appellant was present with the deceased 2nd accused when an item of jewellery

was pawned.

Apart from the purported conversation overheard by witness Vasudevan, the only

other item of evidence the prosecution led to connect the accused-appellant to the

crime, was the evidence of witness Sundaralingam which I have referred to earlier.

The significance of this evidence was that the item of jewellery that Salam and the

accused-appellant alleged to have pawned to Sundaralingam, was identified as the

chain that was worn by Uma-Devi when she left home for the last time.

Here again, Sundaralingam was questioned by the police after more than one year

had elapsed since the death of Uma-Devi. Therefore, when his statement was

recorded, he was required to recollect a transaction that he had performed with

the deceased 2nd accused more than a year before. Sundaralingam being a

businessman, it is reasonable to presume, that he is a man who attends to this type

of transactions day in and day out, in the normal course of his business. The Court

was in no position to gauge the frequency of such transactions; he may have

carried out hundreds of such transactions in that year. The witness was asked to

recollect all of a sudden, the details of a transaction that had taken place around

12 months before, where the deceased 2nd accused had pawned an item of

jewellery. Here again the only way to test his memory was to allow the witness to

narrate the transaction as best as he could remember. He did say that it was the

deceased Salam, who brought the item of jewellery, it was Salam, who handed over

22

the piece of jewellery to him and the witness wrote out a note recording the

transaction in the name of Salam.

Here again, I observe that the manner in which this witness had been questioned

by the learned State Counsel is improper and as a result, the probative value of

Sundaralingam’s evidence is diminished to such an extent, that I do not think that

the evidence of Sundaralingam should be taken into consideration, against the

accused-appellant.

I shall advert to the questioning:

Q එදහම නාවලපිටිදේ වයාොර කරන අය, ඒ විදියට උකස් කරලා සල්ලලි අරදෙන යනවෙ

A. ඔව්

Q. හාරිස් , සලාම් දෙන්නත් ඇවිල්ලල අරදෙන ගිය අවස්ථා තිදයනවෙ ?

A. ඔව්

Q. තමාට මමාකක් හරි විම ේෂ අවසේථාවක් මතකද ඒ මදන්න ඇවිල්ල යම් කිසි රන් බඩුවක්

උකසේ තිබ්බා ?

A. ඔව්

Up to this point of questioning, the witness had never said that both the accused-

appellant and the deceased 2nd accused had approached him to pawn an item of

jewellery.

The question (referred to above) suggests to the witness that both of them (Salam

and the accused appellant) in fact had come to his shop to pawn jewellery. Thus,

the manner of questioning referred to above has thereby substantially diminished

23

the probative value of the testimony. It is significant to note that under cross

examination, he had only made reference to the deceased 2nd accused as the person

who brought the chain for pawning. For completeness, I have reproduced below,

that evidence as well:

Q. බඩු ෙන්ඩ එන කස්ටමර් දකදනක් හැටියට කියන්ඩ දෙන් එක අරදෙන ඇවිල්ලල

A. ඔව් සලාම් තමයි මදේ අතට බාරදුන්දන්.

The Accused -appellant in his dock statement had denied that he ever went with

Salam to pawn jewellery to Sundaralingam and the Court of Appeal does not

appear to have considered the dock statement of the accused-appellant.

As referred to earlier the purported conversation between the deceased 2nd

accused Salam and the accused appellant and the evidence relating to the pawning

24

of the chain are the only two items of evidence led against the accused-appellant

to establish the charge of murder and the charge of gang rape. As far as the offence

of rape is concerned, the prosecution has placed no evidence whatsoever. Both the

learned trial judge and their lordships of the Court of Appeal, however, had

thought it fit to convict the accused -appellant on that count based on the two items

of evidence referred to.

In relation to both these items of evidence, it would be pertinent to apply the rule

laid down in the case of D.P.P v. Christie 1914 A.C 545

In the said case Lord Moultan said that where the evidential value of some evidence

is slender, whereas the prejudicial effect which its reception might have on the

minds of the jurors would potentially be so substantial as seriously to impair the

fairness of the trial, it ought not to be admitted.

Reiterating the rule, Lord du Parcq in the case of Noor Mohamed vs. R 1949 A.C

182 said;

“In all such cases the judge ought to consider whether the evidence is

sufficiently substantial having regard to the purpose to which it is

professedly directed, to make it desirable in the interest of justice that it

should be admitted. If, so far as the purpose is concerned, it can in the

circumstances have only trifling weight, the judge will be right to exclude

it.”

For reasons adumbrated above, I hold that, due to the inherent weaknesses in the

evidence, the evidence cannot be acted upon and in the absence of any other

incriminating evidence, the conviction against the accused-appellant cannot be

sustained. It appears that the Court of Appeal had also misdirected itself by holding

that the evidence of the investigating officer had revealed that witness

Sundaralingam to whom the chain had been pawned was discovered on a

statement made by both, the accused-appellant and the deceased 2nd accused.

It must be noted that the prosecution had not led any evidence under Section 27 of

the Evidence Ordinance with regard to any discovery of fact, consequent to the

statements made by the accused at the trial and secondly, it is trite law that the

discovery of a witness consequent to a statement made by a witness cannot be

considered as a discovery of a fact for the purpose of Section 27.

For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the conviction and the sentence

imposed on the accused-appellant cannot be sustained.

Accordingly, I set aside both the judgments of the learned High Court Judge as well

as the Court of Appeal and make order acquitting the accused-appellant of all

charges in the indictment.

In view of the above finding, answering the 4th question of law on which special

leave to appeal was granted, does not arise. Suffice it to say that the prosecution

had not led any evidence to show that the accused-appellant was complicit in any

way in committing the offence of gang rape.

As the 3rd accused had not preferred an appeal against the judgment of the Court

of Appeal, I do not wish to disturb the findings against the 3rd accused.

The appeal of the 1st Accused-Appellant-Appellant is allowed.
