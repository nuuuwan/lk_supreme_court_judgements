    "text": "S. EVA WANASUNDERA PCJ. The Appellants in this case have appealed to this Court from the judgement of the Commercial High Court of Colombo dated 08.07.2009. The said judgment was in favour of the Plaintiff Respondent, the People\u2019s Bank (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff Bank). By Plaint dated 28.10.2005, the Plaintiff Bank had filed action against the two partners of the business being carried on under the name and style of Zaid Tea. The said two partners are the 1st and 2nd Defendant Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant Appellants). The Plaintiff sought a judgment and decree in a sum of Rs. 28,037,446.11 and interest thereon at the rate of 24% per annum on a sum of Rs. 16,914,333.15 from 01.11.2003 until the date of the decree and thereafter legal interest on the aggregate sum until the payment in full. The Defendant Appellants had filed answer denying the averments in the plaint and claiming that they are not liable to pay. The trial proceeded on seven admissions and 64 issues raised by the parties on 13.09.2006. The subject matter of the case before the trial court was the purchase of 4 foreign bills by the Plaintiff Bank on the application and at the request of the Defendant Appellants. The Plaintiff Bank claimed that the money used to purchase the four Foreign Bills on the application of the Defendant Appellants had to be paid back to the Plaintiff Bank by the Defendant Appellants. However, the main defense of the Defendant Appellants was that the Plaintiff Bank should recover the purchase money of the Foreign Bills not from the Defendant Appellants but from SLECIC (Sri Lanka Export Credit Insurance Corporation) from whom the purchase of bills were secured. The Plaintiff Bank led in evidence documents marked X1 to X18 through the Deputy Manager, Special Assets Unit. The 1st Defendant Appellant had given evidence marking V1 to V10 in evidence. The partnership of the Defendant Appellants, Zaid Tea had been a customer of the Bank for a length of time and they had enjoyed other facilities granted by the Bank. One such other facility was \u2018export trust receipt\u2019 facility granted to the same Defendants, the partners of Zaid Tea, on the security granted by SLECIC",

The Defendant Appellants\u2019 own document marked as V1 specifically indicates that there was no security of SLECIC in respect of the Foreign Bills purchase facility. Moreover, the Plaintiff Bank\u2019s witness, when giving evidence categorically stated that the pre shipment credit guarantee of SLECIC is applicable to export trust receipt facility and not to the Foreign Bills purchase facility which forms the subject matter of the case before the Commercial High Court. Right along, when giving evidence on 27.02.2008, the witness of the Bank had reiterated this position and even in cross examination, he had quite specifically confirmed this position. The High Court Judge , writing the judgment has explained the reasoning very well as follows:- tfukau\u201d meusKs,af,a idlaIslre yria m%YaK j,g ms<s;=re fouska\u201d os.ska os.gu lshd we;af;a\u201d js\u20191 f,aLKh fuu kvqjg mdol .Kqfokq j,g wkod< nj fjs\u2019 tfukau js;a;s jdplhka f,i f.k we;s iaf,isla rlaIK wdjrKh fuu kvqfjs .Kqfokqj,g wkod< nj;a\u201d th wod< jqfha\u201d wmkhkh Ndr l=js;dkais Kh fjkqfjka muKla nj;a yria m%YaK j,g ms<s;=re f,i lshd we;\u2019 js\u20191 foi ne,sfusos o js\u20191 wod< hehs ;ralh ioZyd Wm l,amkh lrk jsfgl jqj;a\u201d tys 4 jk myiqlu f,i olajd we;s jsfoaY ns,am;a us,os .eksu iqrlaIs; lsrsug\u201ciaf,isla\u201d rlaIKh b,a,d ke;\u2019 th wod< js we;af;a\u201d meusks,af,a idlaIslre lshk f,ig u 3 jk jk myiqlus jra.h jk wmkhk Ndr l=js;dkais us,g .eksugh\u2019 iaf,isla rlaIKh fuu kvqfjs .Kqfokq j,g wod< fkdjk nj;a\u201d nexl=fjs b,a,su iaf,isla wdh;khg bosrsm;a lf,a wmkhk Ndr l=js;dkaisfha ys.Z uqo,a whlr .eksug wod<j nj;a\u201d meusKs,af,a idlaIslre yria m%YaK j,g ms,s;=re f,i lshdo we;\u2019 Even supposing there was a security cover for Foreign Bills purchase, the security cover is taken by the business person from SLECIC and then who can claim the money from SLECIC? It is not the Bank who wanted the security cover but the businessman who obtained such a cover. In the case in hand , if there was such a security cover, it is only the Defendant Appellants who could legally make the claim. In fact there was no such security cover. The 1st Defendant Appellant in his evidence had rather admitted that the pre shipment credit guarantee of SLECIC is in respect of the \u201c export trust receipt facility\u201d. It was not for \u201cforeign bills purchase\u201d. The 1st Defendant Appellant was the person who ran the business and knew the truth even though it was pleaded by the Defendant Appellants in their answer and the submissions made by their Counsel that the Foreign Bills",

In fact they had filed action to recover the monies from the foreign buyers in the District Court of Colombo. The criteria for repayment the dues to the Bank is not related to whether the Appellants in fact received the sale price or part of it or totally no money at all from the buyers but the fact that such repayment was agreed upon prior to the Bank purchased the Foreign Bills on the application made by the Defendant Appellants on their behalf. The Defendant Appellants had also submitted that the entirety of the evidence had been led before another judge and the judge who had written the judgment had not seen the demeanor of the witnesses and therefore the analysis of the evidence was incorrectly done by the writer of the judgment. I have gone through the said judgment and I find that the second judge had taken up every argument and analyzed the evidence and the documents quite well after having adopted the proceedings with the consent of both parties prior to writing the judgment which is impugned. There is no reason to merit that argument.",
