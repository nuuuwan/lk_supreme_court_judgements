This is an appeal against the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court dated

22.7.2010 wherein the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court set aside

the judgment of the learned District Judge and gave judgment in favour of the

Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff-

Respondent). Being aggrieved by the said judgment the 2nd Defendant-Respondent-

Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant-Appellant) has

appealed to this court. This court by its order dated 28.11.2011 granted leave to

appeal on questions of law set out in paragraphs 12(b),(d),(g),(i),(j),(k) and (m) of

the Amended Petition of Appeal dated 14.9.2011which are set out below.

1. The learned Judges have erred in law by not considering the fact that the

Respondent has failed to identify the corpus.

2. The learned Judges have failed in law in applying Section 103 0f the

Evidence Ordinance to this case.

3. The learned Judges have erred in law by granting damages whereas no

evidence had led in this case with regard to damages.

4. The learned Judges have erred in law by not giving any reason in their

judgment for dismissing the Petitioners counter claim.

4

5. The said judgment is against the weight of the evidence placed before the

court.

6. The judgment is contrary to legal precedents created by superior courts in

similar circumstances.

7. The said judgment is inconsistent with the evidence transpired during the

trial and thus bad in law.

The Plaintiff-Respondent filed this case against the Defendant-Appellant

seeking a declaration that he is the lawful permit holder of the lands described in

the 1st and the 2nd schedules of the plaint. He also sought an order to eject the

Defendant-Appellant from the land described in the 2nd schedule of the plaint and

compensation amounting to Rs.20,000/- per month from the year 1992. The land

described in the 2nd schedule of the plaint is a part of the land described in the 1st

schedule of the plaint. The land described in the 1st schedule of the plaint has been

given to the Plaintiff-Respondent by a permit (P1) given by the State in terms of

Section 19(2) of the Land Development Ordinance on 2.12.1991. This fact has

been proved by the Plaintiff-Respondent. The learned District Judge by his

judgment dated 1.6.2005 dismissed the case of the Plaintiff-Respondent on the

basis that the corpus had not been identified. Is the judgment of the learned District

Judge correct? I now advert to this question. The land for which the Plaintiff-

Respondent seeks a declaration of title has been described in the plaint by

reference to physical metes and bounds. According to Section 41 of the Civil

Procedure Code the land must be described in the plaint so far as possible by

reference to physical metes and bounds or by reference to a sufficient sketch, map

or plan. The word or is important. Section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code

expects the plaintiff to describe in the plaint the land by reference to physical

5

metes and bounds or by reference to a sufficient sketch, map or plan. In the present

case the land has been described in the plaint by reference to physical metes and

bounds. The son of the Plaintiff-Respondent gave evidence and also produced the

permit marked P1which describes the land by reference to physical metes and

bounds. His evidence was not challenged by the Defendant-Appellant. The son of

the Plaintiff-Respondent was not cross-examined by the Defendant-Appellant.

This shows that the Defendant-Appellant has admitted the boundaries of the land

of the Plaintiff-Respondent. When I consider all the above matters, I hold that the

Plaintiff-Respondent has complied with Section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code

with regard to the land for which he sought a declaration of title and has proved the

identification of corpus. The learned District Judge has concluded that the land for

which the declaration of title is sought has not been identified. I must mention here

that there was not even an issue on the question whether corpus has not been

identified. When I consider all the above matters, I hold that the conclusion

reached by the learned District Judge is wrong.

The Plaintiff-Respondents son, in his evidence, stated that the Defendant-

Appellant encroached on to his land described in the 1st schedule of the plaint; that

the encroached area of the land is described in the 2nd schedule of the plaint; and

that the land described in the 2nd schedule of the plaint is a part of the land

described in the 1st schedule of the plaint. The Defendant-Appellant did not cross-

examine the above witness. This shows that the Defendant-Appellant has not

challenged the evidence of the Plaintiff-Respondent. Therefore it appears that the

Plaintiff-Respondent has proved that the Defendant-Appellant has encroached to

his land and that the encroached area has been described in the 2nd schedule of the

plaint. Further the Plaintiff-Respondent has proved that the land described in the

2nd schedule of the plaint is a part of the land described in the 1st schedule of the

6

plaint. The Defendant-Appellant did not give evidence. The learned District Judge

decided that the Permit of the Plaintiff-Respondent (P1) has been proved by him.

When I consider the evidence led at the trial, I am of the opinion that the Plaintiff-

Respondent has proved that he is the lawful permit holder of the land described in

the plaint. If the Plaintiff-Respondent is the permit holder of the land described in

the plaint, he can maintain a rei-vindicatio action. In Palisena Vs Perera 56 NLR

407 it was held that a permit holder under the Land Development Ordinance enjoys

a sufficient title to enable him to maintain vindicatory action against a trespasser.

In Bandarnayke Vs Karunawathi [2003] 3SLR 295 it was held that a permit holder

under the LDO enjoys sufficient title to enable him to maintain a vindicatory action

against a trespasser. In Dharnadasa Vs Jayasena [1997] 3SLR 327 GPS de Silva CJ

held that in a rei vindicatio action, the burden is on the plaintiff to establish the title

pleaded and relied on by him. In the present case the learned District Judge also

decided that the permit of the Plaintiff-Respondent had been proved by him.

Considering all the above matters, I hold that the Plaintiff-Respondent has

established his title to the land to maintain a vindicatory action.

The Defendant-Appellant has however raised an issue on prescription in

respect of his land. According to the conclusion of the learned District Judge, this

issue has not been proved. What is the intention of an encroacher to a land? His

intention is to secretly possess and acquire lands for which he has no title and to

expand the area of encroachment day by day. His intention is secret and dishonest.

A person who possesses a land with a secret intention cannot claim prescription in

terms of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance because his possession cannot be

considered as an adverse possession. Even a co-owner who possesses a co-owned

land cannot claim prescription in terms of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

This view is supported by the judgment delivered by the Privy Council in Corea Vs

7

Appuhamy 15 NLR 65 and the judgment of Basnayake CJ in the case of

Gunawardene Vs Samarakoon 60 NLR 481.

In Corea vs Appuhamy (supra) Their Lordships held as follows. A co-

owner's possession is in law the possession of his co-owners. It is not

possible for him to put an end to that possession by any secret intention in

his mind. Nothing short of ouster or something equivalent to ouster could

bring about that result.

In Gunawardene Vs Samarakoon (supra) Basnayake CJ held that possession

qua co-owner cannot be ended by any secret intention in the mind of the

possessing co-owner. The possession of one co-owner does not become

possession by a title adverse to or independent of that of the others till

ouster or something equivalent to ouster takes place.

An Encroacher starts encroaching upon lands for which he has no title and

continues to possess the encroached portion of the land with a secret and dishonest

intention. Therefore his possession in the encroached portion of the land cannot be

considered as an adverse possession. Such a person cannot claim prescriptive title

to the encroached area of the land under Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance

because his possession is not an adverse possession. Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance reads as follows.

Proof of the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a defendant

in any action, or by those under whom he claims, of lands or

immovable property, by a title adverse to or independent of that of the

claimant or plaintiff in such action (that is to say, a possession

unaccompanied by payment of rent or produce, or performance of

8

service or duty, or by any other act by the possessor, from which an

acknowledgment of a right existing in another person would fairly and

naturally be inferred) for ten years previous to the bringing of such

action, shall entitle the defendant to a decree in his favour with costs.

And in like manner, when any plaintiff shall bring his action, or any

third party shall intervene in any action for the purpose of being

quieted in his possession of lands or other immovable property, or to

prevent encroachment or usurpation thereof, or to establish his claim

in any other manner to such land or other property, proof of such

undisturbed and uninterrupted possession as herein before explained,

by such plaintiff or intervenient, or by those under whom he claims,

shall entitle such plaintiff or intervenient to a decree in his favour

with costs:

Provided that the said period of ten years shall only begin to run

against parties claiming estates in remainder or reversion from the

time when the parties so claiming acquired a right of possession to the

property in dispute.

To claim prescriptive title in terms of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance,

the claimants possession to the land should be an adverse possession. This is one

of the conditions that should be proved by the claimant. This view is supported by

the judgment of Weerasuriya J in the case of Seeman Vs David [2000] 3 SLR 23

wherein His Lordship held as follows. The proof of adverse possession is a

condition precedent to claim prescriptive rights. Considering all the above

matters, I hold that an encroacher to a land is not entitled to claim prescriptive title

9

in terms of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance to the encroached area of the

land or to the entire land. In fact when a person encroaches upon lands for which

he has no title, he acquires status of a trespasser in respect of the encroached area

of the land. Trespasser starts possessing lands for which he has no title and

continues to possess the land secretly. As I pointed out earlier, to claim prescriptive

title in terms of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance claimants possession

should be an adverse possession. A person who possesses a land with secret

intention cannot claim that his possession is an adverse possession. Possession of a

land by a person with secret intention cannot be considered as an adverse

possession in terms of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. Thus a trespasser

who violates the law of the land and possesses the land cannot claim benefit of the

law of the land. Thus a trespasser cannot acquire prescriptive title in terms of

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. Same principle applies to an encroacher.

Considering all the aforementioned matters, I hold that an encroacher cannot claim

prescriptive title in terms of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

In a rei vindicatio action, once the court decides that the plaintiff is the

owner of the land and that the defendant has encroached on to the land of the

plaintiff, the court must declare that the plaintiff is the owner of the land and also

make an order for the ejectment of the encroacher (the defendant) since possession

of the encroacher becomes an unlawful possession. This view is supported by the

judicial decision in Pathirana Vs Jayasundera 58 NLR 169 wherein Gratiaen J at

page 172, held that in rei vindicatio action proper, the owner of immovable

property is entitled, on proof of his title, to a decree in his favour for the recovery

of the property and for the ejectment of the person in wrongful occupation. In the

same way, in a case where the plaintiff seeks a declaration that he is the lawful

permit holder of the land given to him in terms of Section 19(2) of the Land

10

Development Ordinance, once the court decides that the plaintiff is the lawful

permit holder of the land and that the defendant has encroached on to the land of

the plaintiff, the court must make an order declaring that the plaintiff is the lawful

permit holder of the land and also must make an order to eject the encroacher (the

defendant). In the present case the Plaintiff-Respondent has established that he is

the lawful permit holder of the land described in the 1st schedule of the plaint and

the Defendant-Appellant has encroached upon the said land. Therefore it becomes

the duty of the court to make an order ejecting the Defendant-Appellant.

Learned counsel for the Defendant-Appellant contended that the area

alleged to have been encroached by the Defendant-Appellant has not been

identified by the Plaintiff-Respondent by way of a plan and that therefore the case

of the Plaintiff-Respondent should fail.

In Gunasekara Vs Punchimenika [2002]2 SLR 43 the Court of Appeal observed

the following facts.

The plaint was filed seeking a declaration of title to an undivided share of a

land. It was pleaded that the defendant-appellant had encroached upon a

portion- the encroached portion was not described with reference to

physical metes and bounds or by reference to any map or sketch. The matter

was fixed for ex-parte trial; after ex-parte trial an application was made to

issue a commission to survey the land and identify the same. The ex-parte

trial did not end up in a judgment. After the return of the commission, the

plaint was amended, a fresh ex-parte trial was thereafter held. After the

decree was served, the defendant-appellant sought to purge default, which

was refused.

11

Court of Appeal held as follows.

The Court was obliged initially to have rejected the original plaint since it

did not describe the portion encroached upon section 46(2)(a) read

together with section 41 of CPC.

What happens when a plaint is rejected on the basis that the encroached area has

not been described by way of a plan or a sketch in a case where a plaintiff seeks a

declaration of title to his land (main land) described in his plaint by reference to

physical metes and bounds or by reference to a sufficient sketch, map or plan?

Then the encroacher would be placed at an advantageous position and would

continue to possess the land without any legal right. Further encroacher may later

make a claim for prescriptive title to the encroached area on the ground that his

right to possess the land has been recognized by court since the plaintiffs case had

earlier been rejected. However it is a question whether the encroacher in such a

case would be successful in his claim. Thus, when the plaint is rejected in a case of

this nature on the aforementioned ground the encroacher who violates the others

legal rights would be placed at an advantageous position and the owner of the land

would be placed at a disadvantageous position. Thus if orders of this nature are

permitted to stand, an encroacher who does not respect the law of the land and

violates the others rights would be protected by orders of court and the rights of

lawful owners of properties would not be protected by courts. At this juncture it is

pertinent to consider observation made by Sansoni J in the case of M.

Kanapathipillai Vs M. Meerasaibo 58 NLR41 at page 43 wherein His Lordship

observed as follows: There is a well-established rule that the law will presume in

favour of honesty and against fraud. The learned District Judge, before making

the impugned order in this case, should have been mindful of the above

12

observation made by His Lordship Sansoni J in M. Kanapathipillais case (supra). I

do not doubt that Gunasekaras case (supra) would have been differently decided if

the above material and legal principle enunciated by Sansoni J were considered.

Thus if courts make orders of this nature (rejecting plaint on the basis that the

encroached area has not been described by way of a plan or a sketch), the courts

would be encouraging violators of law. Therefore, in my view when an owner of a

land files a plaint seeking a declaration of title to his land and to eject an

encroacher or encroachers from his land, he should describe his main land by

reference to physical metes and bounds or by reference to a sufficient sketch, map

or plan. In this regard one should not forget the fact that the plaintiff is seeking a

declaration of title to his main land which has been described in the above manner

which is in conformity with Section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code. The situation

would have been different if an encroacher to a land seeks a declaration on

prescription to the encroached area. Then such a portion of land should be

described by reference to physical metes and bounds or by reference to a sufficient

sketch, map or plan in the plaint. Section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as

follows.

When the claim made in the action is for some specific portion of

land, or for some share or interest in a specific portion of land, then

the portion of land must be described in the plaint so far as possible

by reference to physical metes and bounds or by reference to a

sufficient sketch, map or plan to be appended to the plaint, and not by

name only.

What is the specific portion of land discussed in Section 41 of the Civil Procedure

Code? It has to be noted here that in an action for declaration of title, the claim is

13

made for the main land. Therefore in an action for a declaration of title, the

specific portion of land discussed in Section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code is the

land for which the plaintiff seeks a declaration of title. Therefore in an action for a

declaration of title and ejectment of encroacher from the land, when the land is

described in the plaint by reference to physical metes and bounds or by reference

to a sufficient sketch, map or plan, it is wrong for court to reject the plaint on the

basis that the encroached area has not been described in the plaint by reference

to a sufficient sketch, map or plan.

As I pointed out earlier, the intention of an encroacher is to expand his area

of encroachment day by day. If the encroached area is described by way of a plan

or sketch at the time of filing the case, it may not be the same encroached area at

the time of conclusion of the case. Thus at the time of filing action for a declaration

of title if a plan is annexed to the plaint describing the encroached area and the

court makes an order ejecting the encroacher as per the plan, the encroacher would

still be holding on to another portion of the land even after the order of ejectment is

implemented because his area of encroachment at the time of ejectment may be

larger than what was shown in the plan. In such an event the Plaintiff may have to

file another case to eject the encroacher from the other portion of the land. Thus

there would not be an end to litigation and this type of procedure would support the

allegation of laws delays. Therefore it appears that the unwritten principle in law

enunciated by Sansoni CJ in the case of H.A.M Cassim Vs Government Agent

Batticaloa 69 NLR 403 that there must be finality in litigation would be violated

if the courts of this country start rejecting plaints as discussed above. When I

consider all the above matters, I feel that producing a plan describing the area of

encroachment cannot be expected when the owner of a land files action seeking a

declaration of title to his main land and for ejectment of encroacher. In an action

14

for a declaration of title, if the plaintiff establishes his case and the court gives

judgment in favour of the plaintiff, and in the plaint an order for ejectment of

encroacher or encroachers is also sought, it becomes the duty of court to make an

order to eject the encroacher from the main land irrespective of the fact that the

encroached area is described by way of metes and bounds or a plan or a sketch.

Considering all the aforementioned matters, I hold the view that when the plaintiff

who claims to be the owner of a land files a case seeking a declaration of title to

his land and also an order to eject an encroacher or encroachers from his main

land, what is expected by Section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code is to describe his

main land by reference to physical metes and bounds or by reference to a sufficient

sketch, map or plan but the said section does not expect to describe the encroached

area in the plaint by reference to physical metes and bounds or by reference to a

sufficient sketch, map or plan.

But in the present case although learned counsel for the Defendant-Appellant

contended that the encroached area has not been described by way of a plan, the

encroached area has been identified by way of boundaries. In this connection

Section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code is important.

In the present case, the encroached area by the Defendant-Appellant has been

described in the 2nd schedule of the plaint by way of boundaries. Thus the

encroached area has been described in the plaint by reference to physical metes and

bounds. I therefore hold that the Plaintiff-Respondent has complied with Section

41of the Civil Procedure Code even with regard to the encroached area which is

not necessary. When I consider all the aforementioned matters, I reject the

contention of learned counsel for the Defendant-Appellant. When I consider all the

above matters, I hold that the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court

15

have come to the correct conclusion and the learned District Judge was wrong

when he dismissed the Plaintiffs case. In view of the conclusion reached above, I

answer the above questions of law No.1,3,4,5,6,7 in the negative. The question of

law No.2 does not arise for consideration. For all the above reasons, I affirm the

judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court and dismiss this appeal with costs. The

Plaintiff-Respondent is entitled to the costs in all three courts.

Appeal dismissed.
