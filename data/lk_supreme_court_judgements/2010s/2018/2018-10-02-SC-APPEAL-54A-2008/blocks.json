And what must he prove ? He must prove not only an intention on his part to possess adversely, but a manifestation of that intention to the true owner against whom sets up his possession.\u201d. [emphasis mine]. Similarly, in SIYANERIS vs. JAYASINGHE UDENIS DE SILVA [52 NLR 289 at p.292], the Privy Council emphasised that \u201c\u2026if a person goes into possession of land in Ceylon as an agent for another time does not begin to run until he has made it manifest that he is holding adversely to his principal.\u201d [emphasis mine]. In JAYANERIS vs. SOMAWATHIE [76 NLR 206 at p.207-0208], Weeramantry J stated \u201cThe adverse aspect of his possession cannot in other words remain a mere concept in the recesses of the agent's mind but must so manifest itself that those against whom it is urged may see in it a challenge to their claims. Even as possession qua co-owner cannot be ended by any secret intention in the mind of the possessing co-owner, so also is possession through an agent incapable of being affected adversely by an uncommunicated attitude or mental state existing in the mind of that self-same agent.\u201d. Thereafter, in DE SILVA vs. COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE [80 NLR 292 at p. 295-296], Sharvananda J, as His Lordship then was, lucidly enunciated the applicable principles and the rationale that lay behind these principles and, thereafter, held \u201cWhere possession commenced with permission, it will be presumed to so continue until and unless something adverse occurred about it. The onus is on the licensee to show when and how the possession became adverse.\u201d.

However, a perusal of the facts in that decision show that, quite apart from a long period of possession, the defendant had always possessed the property as the sole owner without any knowledge of a rival claimant to the property. In ALWIS vs. PERERA [21 NLR 321], Bertram CJ held that, where a party\u201fs possession of land admittedly commenced in a subordinate character, the possession of the land by that party for a \u201cvery considerable length of time\u201d may justify a Court in drawing a `presumption of ouster\u201f provided the other circumstances of the case justified doing so. In this connection, the learned Chief Justice said [at p.324] \u201c\u2026.. where it is shown that people have been in possession of land for a very considerable length of time, that fact, taken in conjunction with the other circumstances of the case, may justify a Court in presuming that the possession which originated in one manner, as, for example, by permission, may have changed its character, and that at some point it became adverse possession\u201d. [emphasis mine].The circumstances which led Bertram CJ to consider that there had been adverse possession included the parties who claimed prescriptive title remaining in possession of the land for over sixty years after transferring the property to the opposing party\u201fs predecessor in title and also one of the parties who claimed prescriptive title successfully asserting title to the land and resisting a seizure of the land in execution of a writ against one of the opposing parties. In the later case of HAMIDU LEBBE vs. GANITHA [27 NLR 33 at p.39], Dalton J observed that \u201cIn the result it seems to me that the law of this Colony on this point is clearly laid down in Tillekeratne v. Bastian (supra). It is a question of fact where ever long-continued exclusive possession by one co-owner is proved to have existed, whether it is not just and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case that the parties should be treated as though it had been proved that that separate and exclusive possession had become adverse at some date more than ten years before action brought.\u201d. Similarly, in RAN NAIDE vs. PUNCHI BANDA [31 NLR 478 at p.480] Jayewardene AJ held that \u201cIt is open to the Court from lapse of time in conjunction with other circumstances to presume that a possession, originally permissive, has since then become adverse.\u201d [emphasis mine].",

In this regard, His Lordship stated \u201cThe presumption of ouster is drawn, in certain circumstances, when the exclusive possession has been so long-continued that it is not reasonable to call upon the party who relies on it to adduce evidence that at a specific point of time, in the distant past, there was in fact a denial of the rights of the other co-owners. The duration of exclusive possession being so long it would not be practicable in such a case to lead the evidence of persons who would be in a position to speak from personal knowledge as to how the adverse possession commenced. Most of the persons who had such knowledge may be dead or cannot be traced or are incapable of giving evidence when the case comes up for trial. In such a situation it would be reasonable, in certain circumstances, to draw the presumption of ouster.\" This approach was also followed by Wimalaratne J in WALPITA vs. DHARMASENA [1980 2 SLR 183]. However, it is clear that, such a `presumption of ouster\u201f cannot be drawn in the present case for the simple reason that both the defendant and her son testified and were in a position to state the basis on which the defendant claims to have commenced possessing the property adverse to and independent of the owner of the property.",

The defendant relies on Dissanayake J\u201fs citation of the statement by Withers J in ANTHONISZ vs. CANNON [3 CLR 65 at p. 67] that \"Once given exclusive power to deal with immovable property, if that power is continuously exercised without disturbance and interruption and without any act of acknowledgement of another's title for ten years previous to action brought, the animus possidendi shall be imputed to him who has so exclusively exercised that power, if he chooses to claim the property for himself, and a decree shall be awarded him accordingly.\". However, this statement by Withers J must be read as being qualified by the principle established in the line of decisions commencing from MADUANWALA vs. EKNELIGODA that an overt act is required to shed the character of subordinate possession by a licensee or an agent and start the running of prescription.

This requirement is imposed because the plaintiff must be given notice of the nature of the claim of prescriptive title so that he can seek to meet it at the trial. The requirement that these details must be given in the answer is an application of the principle stipulated in section 40 (d) of the Civil Procedure Code that a plaint shall set out where and when a cause of action arose read with section 70 (e) of the Civil Procedure Code which imposes a similar requirement when a defendant makes a claim in reconvention in the answer.",

Therefore, it follows that the defendant cannot claim to have prescribed to the property up to 31st August 1978 when the Executor\u201fs Conveyance marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 2\u201d transferred the property to the plaintiff\u201fs father. Next, it seen from the facts narrated earlier that, on 31st August 1978, the plaintiff\u201fs father has purchased the property with the defendant being the incumbent licensee. Therefore, as far as the plaintiff\u201fs father was concerned, the defendant was holding the property as his licensee when he acquired title to the property. The plaintiff\u201fs father had taken no action to terminate that license or to request the defendant to leave the property and it can be reasonably presumed that the plaintiff\u201fs father was happy to permit the status quo to continue and to allow the defendant to continue in occupation of the property as his licensee. In these circumstances, if the defendant wished to transform her possession from that of a licensee to possession adverse to or independent of the title of the plaintiff\u201fs father, the defendant was mandatorily obliged to commit some overt act which served to demonstrate to the plaintiff\u201fs father that she did not acknowledge any right he had to the property and that she was possessing the property adverse to and independent of the plaintiff\u201fs father. As stated earlier, a \u201csecret act\u201d or a \u201csecret intention\u201d on the part of the defendant would not suffice to render the defendant\u201fs possession of the land adverse to or independent of the title of the plaintiff\u201fs father.

It is necessary that the witnesses should speak to specific facts, and the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by court. Peynis v. Pedro [3 SCC 125]. In the present case there is a significant absence of clear and specific evidence on such acts of possession as would entitle the 1st defendant to a decree in his favour in terms of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.\u201d. In KIRIAMMA vs. PODIBANDA [2005 BLJ Vol.XI 9 at p.11], Udalagama J observed that \u201c\u2026considerable circumspection is necessary to recognise prescriptive title as undoubtedly it deprives the ownership of the party having paper title.\u201d. His Lordship referred [at p.13 and at p.14] to the need for \u201cassertive evidence of adverse possession as against mere evidence of occupation\u201d and \u201cassertive and cogent evidence\u201d to prove the acquisition of prescriptive title. When these standards are applied to the present case, it is seen that the defendant was required to adduce adequate and reliable evidence to establish, on a balance of probability, that she had committed some overt act or acts which demonstrated to the plaintiff\u201fs father that she did not acknowledge that he had any right to the property and that she was possessing the property adverse to and independent of his title to the property. However, the evidence of the defendant and her son does not suggest that they did any such thing. In this connection, the defendant does not claim that she made any statement to the plaintiff\u201fs father that she does not accept his title. The defendant does not claim that, after the plaintiff\u201fs father obtained title, she made any alterations to the property or paid the rates and taxes in respect of the property in her name or obtained electricity and water connections in her name. The defendant has not led the evidence of the Grama Sevaka or her neighbours to suggest that she was considered to be holding the property in her own right after the property was transferred to the plaintiff\u201fs father in 1978.",

Colombo Case No.6938/RE marked \u201c\u0dc0\u0dd2 2\u201d reveals that, some years after the plaintiff\u201fs father gifted the property to the plaintiff, the plaintiff\u201fs mother instituted that action against the defendant praying for a declaration of title to the property and the ejectment of the defendant and that the plaintiff\u201fs mother\u201fs action was dismissed solely because she had no title to the property. Thus, this judgment has no adverse impact on the plaintiff\u201fs case which is before us. It is also seen that the defendant has not produced the plaint, her answer or the proceedings in D.C. Colombo Case No.6938/RE to support her claim in the present case. Here too, it can be presumed that presenting this evidence would have been unfavourable to the defendant\u201fs claim [in the case before us] that she has prescribed to the property. Thus, the defendant has failed to discharge the burden placed on her to prove that she committed some overt act or acts which demonstrated that she did not acknowledge the plaintiff\u201fs father\u201fs title to the property and that she was possessing the property adverse to and independent of the plaintiff\u201fs father. To again apply the words of Bertram CJ in in TILLEKERATNE vs. BASTIAN, the defendant has not demonstrated to the plaintiff\u201fs father that the defendant had \u201can intention on his [her] part to possess adversely\u201d and had not demonstrated \u201ca manifestation of that intention\u201d to the plaintiff\u201fs father. Instead, in the aforesaid circumstances, it is evident that the defendant continued to hold the property as a licensee after the plaintiff\u201fs father acquired title on 31st August 1978 by the Executor\u201fs Conveyance marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 2\u201d and that the defendant did nothing to change that status quo until the plaintiff\u201fs father gifted the property to the plaintiff on 27th October 1981 by the Deed of Gift marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 2\u201d. Next, prescription could not commence to run against the plaintiff after he obtained title to the property on 27th October 1981 by the Deed of Gift marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 2\u201d since it has been established that the plaintiff was a minor at that time. That is because section 13 of the Prescription Ordinance stipulates that prescription could not begin to run against the plaintiff so long as he remains a minor. It is seen from the plaintiff\u201fs birth certificate marked \u201c\u0db4\u0dd0 4\u201d that the plaintiff attained majority on 20th January 1990. Therefore, at best, prescription could commence to run in the defendant\u201fs favour against the plaintiff only from 20th January 1990 onwards. However, this action has been instituted by the plaintiff on 26th February 1992 \u2013 i.e.: a mere two years and a month after prescription could have, at the earliest, commenced to run against the plaintiff.

The learned Judge of the Court of Appeal erred when she held that the defendant had acquired prescriptive title and set aside the judgment of the District Court granting the plaintiff the reliefs prayed for in the plaint. The learned Judge of the Court of Appeal failed to realise that the defendant had placed before Court only the flimsiest of evidence and that the defendant had not adduced any reliable evidence to prove she had acquired prescriptive title after, admittedly, commencing possession of the property as a licensee. Accordingly, questions of law no.s (i) to (v) are answered in favour of the plaintiff. In view of this conclusion, it is not necessary to consider question of law no. (vi). This appeal is allowed and the judgment dated 20th June 2007 of the Court of Appeal is set aside. The judgment of the District Court is affirmed. In the circumstances of the case, the parties will bear their own costs. Judge of the Supreme Court Vijith K. Malalgoda, PC, J. I agree Judge of the Supreme Court L.T.B. Dehideniya J. I agree Judge of the Supreme Court",
