Allowing for differences in the system of pleading,\n\nthis answer will apply equally to the Roman Law, the Dutch Law, and the law\n\nof this Colony. In regard to the Roman system of civil process it is well known\n\nthat the mode of procedure underwent great changes from the early times of\n\nRome to the time of Justinian. Throughout these changes, however, it was\n\nalways considered necessary that the time when a contested right was to be\n\nconsidered as really made the subject of litigation should be carefully marked.\n\nIn the time of Justinian an action was begun with the denunciatio actionis, by\n\nwhich the plaintiff announced to a magistrate that he wished to bring an\n\naction. and furnished a short statement of his case. This statement might be\n\noral or in writing, and was sent by the Magistrate, through a bailiff of the\n\nCourt, to the defendant. The parties or their procurators appeared before the\n\nMagistrate, and he then and there decided the case. (...) The litis contestatio\n\ntook place directly the Magistrate began to hear the cause.\n\nIn Holland the mode of procedure was far more cumbrous, and the difficulty of\n\nmarking the exact time when the litis contestatio took place was\n\nproportionately greater than under the Roman system. In summary causes\n\n(such as actions for a decree of civil imprisonment, or for a decree of perpetual\n\nsilence) there was not much difficulty, for as soon as the defendant had\n\nobjected to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the litis contestatio was held to have taken\n\neffect (....), for the Court might then hear and decide the case without further\n\npleadings.\n\nAgain, a kind of fictitious litis contestatio was, according to Voet, admitted"

Unless, in my view, permitting the legal heirs\n\nof the original Defendant at this stage to \u2018set the clock back\u2019 would cause grave\n\nprejudice to the Plaintiff.\n\nTherefore, I am of the view that once legal representatives\u2019 step into the shoes\n\nof a deceased Plaintiff or Defendant, as the case may be, they must adopt the\n\nposition occupied by their predecessor.\n\n15\n\nThe legal representatives, therefore, must proceed with the litigation from the\n\nstage at which the death of the Defendant or Plaintiff occurred.

In cases where the decree or any subsequent order directs the payment\n\nof money in installments or the delivery of property on a specified date, the\n\nten-year period is calculated from the date of default in making such payment\n\nor delivering such property.\n\nHowever, as per section 337(2) of the Civil Procedure Code if the judgment-\n\ndebtor has by fraud or force prevented the execution of the decree within that\n\nperiod, the rigidity of this rule is relaxed. In such circumstances, the ten year\n\nperiod begins to run from the date of removal or cessation of such malady or\n\ndisability.\n\nIf the aforementioned statutory bar applies to this case, any consequential steps\n\ntaken following this judgment would be futile.\n\nIn the Supreme Court case of Mohamed Azar v.

The\n\ntime bar will apply in cases where the judgment creditor after becoming\n\nentitled to obtain the writ has slept over his rights for ten years\n\nUnder Section 337(3), which was introduced by Act No. 53 of 1980, a writ of\n\nexecution remains in force for one year from the date of issuance.

    "chunk_text": "Under Section 337(3), which was introduced by Act No. 53 of 1980, a writ of\n\nexecution remains in force for one year from the date of issuance. It may be\n\nrenewed before its expiration for another year from the date of such renewal,\n\nmay be issued until the decree is satisfied, provided the application is made\n\nwithin the ten-year period mentioned above. Before the said amendment, once\n\nan application to execute a decree had been allowed under Section 337(1), no\n\nsubsequent application could be made unless the Court was satisfied that \u2018due\n\ndiligence\u2019 had been exercised on the last preceding application to procure\n\ncomplete satisfaction of the decree. However, this requirement was removed by\n\nthe aforesaid amendment. Irrespective of due diligence, the judgment-creditor\n\nmay now make successive applications for writs until the decree is satisfied. If\n\nthe judgment-creditor did not or could not make an application under Section\n\n325 in case of resistance, obstruction, hindrance, or ouster, they may make an\n\napplication under Section 337 within ten years for a fresh writ or re-issuance of\n\na writ, subject to Section 347.\n\nIn the case at hand, the date of the decree should be November 1, 2002. The\n\nfirst application to serve the decree on the Defendant was made on April 2,\n\n2003, well within the ten-year period, but it was not in order. As stated above in\n\nthis judgment, a decree in proper form was submitted by the Plaintiff only on\n\nNovember 1, 2011, after a long delay. Although the Plaintiff informed the Court\n\nthat the Defendant was passed away, the Court inadvertently ordered the decree\n\nto be served on the Defendant. Since it was the duty of the Court to enter the\n\ndecree, I am of the view that the ten-year period under Section 337 should\n\ncommence from the date the formal decree was entered, which was the date\n\nfrom which the Plaintiff could take steps to serve the decree on the Defendant.\n\n20\n\nConclusion\n\nIn light of the reasoning provided above, the Questions of Law raised are"

(47) The learned President\u2019s Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that (a) the ownership of\n\nthe Vessel remained with the Defendant at all times, (b) the management and control of the Vessel too remained with the Defendant, and (c) the Vessel was never sold and/or delivered to the Plaintiff, although the Vessel was made available to the Plaintiff for its use. It was therefore his submission that the transaction was not a typical sale of a good, and the requirements of Section 8 have not been satisfied. (48) In terms of Section 2(1) it is through a \u2018contract for the sale of a good' that the seller\n\neither transfers or agrees to transfer the property. The former is a sale and the latter is an agreement to sell. Therefore, as provided in Section 59, a \"contract for sale\" can include either a sale or an agreement to sell. An agreement to sell is not considered as a sale, rather it is considered as a contract for the sale of a good. (49) For Section 8 to apply, there are two elements that must be satisfied.

The second is that the Vessel continued to be under the management and control of the Defendant during the time it was under charter to a third party.

The Plaintiff thus had the use of the Vessel from August \u2013 December 2006 on the basis of a charter of the Vessel to the Plaintiff and not because the Vessel had been delivered on approval or sale or return basis. The cumulative effect of the above averments is that the Vessel has not been sold and delivered to the Plaintiff.

Narayanan Chettiar,\n\ndeciding that the application approach test should be preferred over the order\n\napproach test in deciding whether an order is a final or interlocutory order in\n\ncivil proceedings be revisited in this appeal.\n\n[27] SC Appeal No. 41/2015 was filed following a dismissal for non-compliance with\n\nan imperative provision of the Civil Procedure Code, and SC/CHC Appeal No.\n\n37/2008 arose from a dismissal on the ground of prescription. In both cases,\n\nthe lower courts upheld preliminary objections raised by the respective parties\n\nand dismissed the actions. As the questions of law raised in both cases were\n\nidentical, they were taken up together, and the Supreme Court delivered a single\n\nJudgment. In its Judgment dated 04/08/2017, the Supreme Court extensively\n\ndiscussed the decisions in Siriwardana vs. Air Ceylon Limited20, Ranjith\n\nvs. Kusumawathi21 and Rajendra Chettiar vs. Narayanan Chettiar22.\n\nPriyasad Dep, PC, CJ, observed:\n\n\u201cIn two cases before us orders are made in respect of points of law raised by\n\nthe parties.

It stated:\n\nif their decision whichever way it is given, will if it stands finally\n\ndispose of the matter in dispute, I think that for the purpose of\n\nthese rules it is final. On the other hand, if their decision, if given\n\nin one way, finally dispose of the matter in dispute, but if given\n\nthe other, will allow the action to go on, then I think it is not final,\n\nbut interlocutory\u201d\n\n[28] In both instances, upon consideration of the relevant judicial precedent, this\n\nCourt held that the Orders made by the respective Courts were interlocutory in\n\nnature. Accordingly, the proper course available to the aggrieved parties was to\n\ninvoke the jurisdiction of this Court by way of a Leave to Appeal application\n\nunder Section 754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, and not by way of an Appeal\n\nunder Section 754(1). Both Appeals were therefore dismissed.\n\n[29] In the present case, at the commencement of the trial, the Defendants raised a\n\npreliminary objection before the District Court, challenging the maintainability\n\nof the action. The objection was founded on the institution of Case No. 19530/L,\n\npreviously filed against the same Defendants, based on the same cause of action\n\nand in respect of the same land. The Defendants accordingly contended that the\n\npresent action constituted a duplication of proceedings. The Plaintiffs did not\n\nobject to the preliminary objection being raised at the commencement of the\n\nDefendants' case. Having considered the material placed before it, the District\n\nCourt, by Order dated 26/03/2007, upheld the objection and dismissed the\n\nsecond action on the ground that it was not maintainable.\n\nPage 16 of 18"

I conceive that an order is \u2018final\u2019 only\n\nwhere it is made upon an application or other proceeding which must,\n\nwhether such application or other proceeding fail or succeed, determine the\n\naction.

The Plaintiff-Respondent\n\nraised a question of law based on the plea of res judicata through estoppel,\n\nreferencing the Divisional Bench decision Appeal Nos. 101A/2009 and\n\n101B/2009 [SC HCCA LA 174/2008] (Rajendra Chettiar vs. Narayanan\n\nChettiar24).

(No. 2)26, Lord Guest\n\nstated, \u201cany party to such litigation as against any other party is estopped\n\nthe merits.\u201d\n\n[33] It is crucial to recognize that when the District Court dismissed the second\n\naction, it did not consider or resolve the rights and liabilities of the parties on\n\nthe merits, nor did it issue a final Judgment. By Order dated 26/03/2007, the\n\nDistrict Court inter alia, upheld the plea of res judicata by way of estoppel and\n\naccordingly dismissed the action. At the time the District Court made its Order,\n\nan Appeal against the Order in the first action was pending before the Court of\n\nAppeal. The Court held that although the Plaintiff admitted to filing the Appeal\n\nand undertook to withdraw it, the Plaintiff had failed to establish that the\n\napplication to withdraw the Appeal bearing No. C.A. 412/03 had been allowed,\n\nor that the Appeal had in fact been withdrawn.\n\n[34] Applying the application approach to the present case, it is evident that the\n\ndismissal of the Plaintiff\u2019s second action arose from a preliminary objection\n\ntaken at the commencement of proceedings. While the decision to uphold the\n\nobjection brought the action to an end, had the objection been overruled, the\n\nmatter would have proceeded to trial, leaving the parties\u2019 substantive rights yet\n\nto be decided. The decisive consideration is whether the Order necessarily\n\nconcludes the litigation irrespective of the outcome of the application. On this\n\ntest, the Order dated 26/03/2007 must be regarded as interlocutory.\n\n[35] Considering all the above circumstances, it cannot be said that the decision of\n\nthe District Court, in dismissing the second action, was final and conclusive\n\nbetween the parties on the merits so as to operate as a complete bar to further\n\nproceedings. Accordingly, I hold that the Order dated 26/03/2007 is not a Final\n\n26 1967 (1) AC. 853\n\nPage 18 of 18"

The Appellant, by way of reply submissions dated 23rd March 2010, vehemently\n\ndisputed this position, maintaining that P4 could not in law be construed as an\n\nassessment, and reiterating that the assessment was made only on 11th June 2008, well\n\nbeyond the period of three years.\n\n15. On 1st July 2010, a determination was issued under the delegated authority of the\n\nCommissioner General of Inland Revenue, which reduced the taxable income but did\n\nnot address the time-bar objection.\n\n16. By letter dated 6th July 2010, the Appellant communicated its dissatisfaction with this\n\ndetermination, as required under Section 138(1) of the Act. On 14th July 2010, by a\n\nletter, the Commissioner General communicated the reasons for the determination,\n\nindicating expressly that questions concerning the legal validity of the assessment\u2014\n\nincluding the issue of time bar\u2014would not be considered by him, as such matters were\n\nfor judicial determination.\n\n17.

The Court of Appeal, upon consideration of the pleadings and submissions, by its\n\njudgment dated 18th July 2014, dismissed the application.

It further held that no illegality or jurisdictional defect was apparent on the face of the\n\nrecord which warranted intervention by way of writ, that the plea of time bar was not\n\nraised at the earliest opportunity but was introduced belatedly, and that the\n\ndetermination of the Commissioner General reducing the assessment of the taxable\n\nincome did not disclose any error of law on its face that would justify the issuance of an\n\norder in the nature of a writ.\n\n21.

It is their contention that the Act\n\nintentionally separates these two steps and provides a time limit only for the first.\n\nstatutory period, it is free to send the notice to the taxpayer at any time thereafter.

Ifindthisposition ofthe Respondenttobe untenableandafundamental\n\nmisinterpretation of both the plain language of the statute and the foundational\n\nprinciples of Sri Lankan tax jurisprudence.\n\n32. The legal authority to charge, levy and collect tax is a creature of statute, and when the\n\nlegislature, in its wisdom, imposes a time-bar, it does so to provide certainty, finality,\n\nand a vested right to the taxpayer. The Respondent\u2019s defence, which hinges on the\n\nclaim that an assessment can be secretly completed and then notified at its\n\nconvenience, is a direct assault on these core principles.\n\n33. It is a fundamental precept of a just legal system that a public authority must act not\n\nonly within its statutory mandate but also with transparency and accountability. To\n\nallow the state to hold taxpaying entities in a state of perpetual uncertainty, to keep a\n\ntax liability in a secret departmental file, and to issue a demand at its leisure would be\n\nto subvert the very purpose of the law.\n\n34. The questions that fall to be determined on this branch of the case are whether the\n\nimpugned assessment was validly made within the period of three years prescribed by\n\nSection 134(5) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000, and to that end, whether the\n\nletter dated 25th March 2008 styled as an \u201cintimation\u201d could, in law, constitute an\n\nassessment so as to save the assessment from being time-barred.\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 12 of 28"

One of the earliest authorities in this jurisdiction is Commissioner of Income Tax v\n\nChettinad Corporation Ltd. (1954)1 where Gratiaen J. drew attention to the linguistic\n\ndistinction between an \u201cassessment\u201d and a \u201cnotice of assessment\u201d. Gratiaen J. explained\n\nthe position in the following terms:\n\n\u201cThe distinction between an \u2018assessment\u2019 and a \u2018notice of assessment\u2019 is thus\n\nmade clear: the former is the departmental computation of the amount of tax\n\nwith which a particular assessee is considered to be chargeable and the latter is\n\nthe formal intimation to him of the fact that such an assessment has been\n\nmade.\u201d2\n\n37. If this notion were to be accepted, it would mean that under the Inland Revenue Act No.\n\n38 of 2000, the Assessor is only required to make the internal computation within the\n\nstipulated three years, while being free to indefinitely delay the issuance of the Notice\n\nof Assessment.\n\n38. But this is not the scheme of the 2000 Act. Section 134(1) specifically provides that an\n\nAssessor may \u201cassess the amount \u2026 and shall by notice in writing require such person to\n\npay forthwith.\u201d The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d makes it clear that the duty to compute tax\n\nliability and the duty to issue notice are inseparably linked. The section treats them as a\n\nsingle statutory act, not as two independent steps.\n\n1 55 NLR 553\n\n2 ibid, at p. 556 (emphasis added)\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 13 of 28\n\n39.

Samarakoon C.J. emphasized that the purpose of requiring reasons, was to ensure that\n\nthe Assessor genuinely applied their mind to the taxpayer\u2019s return and reached a\n\ndefinite determination. His Lordship stated:\n\n\u201cThe primary purpose of the amending legislation is to ensure that the Assessor\n\nwill bring his mind to bear on the return and come to a definite determination\n\nwhether or not to accept it. It was intended to prevent arbitrary and grossly\n\nunfair assessments which many Assessors had been making as \u201ca protective\n\nmeasure\". An unfortunate practice had developed where some Assessors, due to\n\npressure of work and other reasons, tended to delay looking at a return till the\n\nlast moment and then without a proper scrutiny of the return, made a grossly\n\nexaggerated assessment. Under the amendment when an Assessor does not\n\naccept a return, it must mean that at the relevant point of time he has brought\n\nhis mind to bear on the return and has come to a decision rejecting the return.\n\nConsequent to this rejection, the reasons must be communicated to the\n\nAssessee\u2026 His reasons must be communicated at or about the time he sends his\n\nassessment on an estimated income.

This passage highlights two critical principles. First, the giving of reasons is not a mere\n\nprocedural formality; it is a substantive requirement ensuring that the assessment\n\nreflects a genuine, considered decision by the Assessor. Second, the timing of the\n\ncommunication is essential; reasons must accompany the notice of assessment at the\n\nmoment the assessment is sent; failing which, the remedial purpose of the legislation is\n\ndefeated. It is noted that in the case at hand, it was also the Appellant\u2019s position at the\n\nstage of appeal to the CGIR that sufficient reasons were not communicated for the\n\nrejection.\n\n46. The dissenting opinion, notably that of Sharvananda J. (as His Lordship was then),\n\ntreated the communication of reasons as a \"directory\" step, suggesting that an internal\n\nassessment could stand even if the reasons were communicated later. However, this\n\nview did not carry the force of binding precedent, while the majority\u2019s reasoning is\n\nbinding on this Court.\n\n47. As E. Gooneratne clearly sets out in his book \u2018Income Tax in Sri Lanka\u2019,\n\n\u201cMaking an assessment culminates in the notice on the person assessed.

The\n\nInspector of Taxes had signed a certificate in the official assessment book on 16th\n\nMarch 1970, but the notices were only served after 7th April 1970.

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,13 D.N.\n\nSamarakoon J. held that the operation of the time bar runs from the sending of the\n\nnotice of assessment, and not from the mere making of the assessment, unless a\n\nproper book or register is maintained to show clearly the date on which the assessment\n\nwas made. His Lordship therefore underscored that the notice of assessment itself must\n\nbe issued within the statutory period of limitation.\n\n56. His Lordship stated:\n\n\u201cHence, the argument of the Tax Appeals Commission in the present case\n\nthat the effective date for the commencement of the time bar is the date of\n\n\u201cmaking \u201cthe assessment not the date of sending the notice could have been\n\naccepted if there was a book or a register maintained by the Commissioner\n\nof Inland Revenue which will be evidence of the date of making of\n\nassessment\u201d.\n\n57. One must appreciate that the law\u2019s requirement for timely and proper notification of\n\ntax assessments is not just a formality; it protects the trust between the State and its\n\ncitizens. Taxes must be fair and not imposed arbitrarily, so that the rights and security\n\nof taxpayers are respected. This idea, that power should be balanced with fairness, is\n\none that has guided just governance for centuries.\n\n12 ibid, at p.30, 31\n\n13 CA Tax 26/2013, CA Minutes of 16th March 2022\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 19 of 28\n\n58.

Just as the bee draws only what it needs, leaving the flower\n\nunharmed to bloom again, so too must the State collect revenue in a manner that\n\nsecures its due without crippling the people who provide it. Taxation must be\n\nrestrained, imposed \u201cgently and without inflicting pain or hardship,\u201d so that both the\n\ngovernment and its citizens may endure and prosper together. The lesson is timeless,\n\nbut perhaps never more important than today.\n\n60. In today\u2019s economy, taxation is not merely a means for the State to raise revenue; it\n\nfunctions like the framework of a bridge that supports commerce and livelihoods.\n\nBusinesses, investors, and individuals build their plans upon it, expecting stability and\n\npredictability.

While it contains certain preliminary calculations, these workings\n\ncannot be framed as a final and binding determination of liability.\n\n65. The letter neither quantifies a conclusive sum payable nor calls upon the Appellant to\n\ndischarge such liability; specifies a date by when the amount shall be settled; nor does\n\nit set out the statutory right of appeal, which is an essential feature of a Notice of\n\nAssessment under Section 136. The computations appear as tentative workings to\n\nsupport the Assessor\u2019s non-acceptance of the return, rather than as the imposition of a\n\ncharge.

The Department must act, and must notify, within that time.\n\n68. There is a wider principle at stake, as I noted earlier. Taxation is a compulsory exaction\n\nbacked by the coercive power of the State. It is therefore imperative that the power to\n\ntax be exercised strictly in accordance with law, and within the boundaries the\n\nlegislature has drawn. Time bars in tax law are not technical traps for the Department;\n\nthey are jurisdictional limits imposed in the interests of certainty, fairness, and discipline.\n\n69.

The power to assess expired on the 31st March 2008 and\n\ncould not be revived thereafter.\n\n70.

At its core, this question concerns the proper role of the Court of Appeal in supervising\n\nadministrative action and ensuring that public authorities act within the limits of their\n\nlegal powers. The Constitution, under Article 140, clearly empowers the Court of Appeal\n\nto issue Writs of Certiorari as a safeguard to enforce the rule of law. The mere existence\n\nof a statutory appeal, which ordinarily addresses errors made within the lawful scope of\n\nauthority, does not limit or displace this constitutional power.\n\n74. I find the distinction between acts committed within jurisdiction and acts wholly\n\nwithout jurisdiction is fundamental. Appeals are designed to correct mistakes made\n\nwithin the authority granted by law, but acts performed outside the authority conferred\n\nby statute are nullities. No appeal can cure an action taken without legal power. As held\n\nin D.M.S. Fernando and Another v. Mohideen Ismail, where a similar contention was\n\nraised by the Deputy Solicitor-General, the Court held that:\n\n\u201dThere was another matter that was raised incidentally. It was contended by\n\nthe Deputy Solicitor\u2011General that the Respondent was not entitled to maintain\n\nthis application for Writ because an alternative remedy by way of appeal was\n\navailable to him under the Inland Revenue Act. Those provisions confine him\n\nto an appeal against the quantum of assessment. The Commissioner has not\n\nbeen given power to order the Assessor to communicate reasons. He may, or\n\nmay not, do so as an administrative act. The Assessor may, or may not, obey.\n\nThe Assessee is powerless to enforce the execution of such administrative acts.\n\nThe present objection goes to the very root of the matter and is independent of"

Commissioner General of\n\nInland Revenue,18\n\n\u201cHowever, judicial review may be granted in exceptional circumstances such as\n\nwhere the alternative statutory remedy is nowhere near so convenient,\n\nbeneficial and effectual or where there is no other equally effective and\n\nconvenient remedy. This is particularly so where the decision in question is\n\nliable to be upset as a matter of law because it is clearly made without\n\njurisdiction or in consequence of an error of law.\u201d19\n\n77. His Lordship further explained:\n\n\u201cAs judicial review is a collateral challenge and not an appeal, it will only be in\n\nexceptional circumstances that the courts will allow the collateral process of\n\njudicial review to be used to attack an appealable decision, when Parliament has\n\nexpresslyprovidedbystatuteanappellateprocedure.Butexceptional\n\ncircumstances may arise when it would be unjust for the taxpayer to appeal a\n\ndecision of the Commissioner \u2013 General. For example, if the Commissioner \u2013\n\nGeneral during the hearing acted illegally or ultra vires, then exceptional"

In aligning with these observations, I, too, am of the view that judicial review is not a\n\nsubstitute for statutory appeal, but serves as a necessary safeguard where the statutory\n\nprocess cannot adequately address the question of legality or jurisdiction. In the\n\npresent case, the Appellant challenged an assessment issued on 11th June 2008, after\n\nthe statutory deadline of 31st March 2008 under Section 134(5) of the Inland Revenue\n\nAct, 2000. The challenge was primarily not to the quantum of tax, but to the very\n\nauthority of the Commissioner General to issue the assessment, which had expired by\n\noperation of law.\n\n79. The statutory appeal mechanism is limited to correcting errors made within the\n\nCommissioner\u2019s lawful authority and cannot provide relief where the assessment itself\n\nis ultra vires or time-barred. Requiring the Appellant to proceed and to confine\n\nthemselves to the statutory appeal would have compelled it to participate in a process\n\nincapable of addressing the legal defect, even after the CGIR explicitly refused to\n\nconsider the time-bar in their reasons for determination marked \u2018P15\u2019 in the brief.\n\nIn such circumstances, where the statutory remedy would not have been practically\n\neffective for the Appellant, the requirements identified by Justice Aluwihare are met.\n\n80.

It is the contention of the Respondents that the act of appealing\n\namounts to an admission of the validity of the assessment and that the Appellant is\n\ntherefore precluded from thereafter denying its legality, which has been accepted by\n\nthe Court of Appeal.\n\n83.

    "chunk_text": "therefore precluded from thereafter denying its legality, which has been accepted by\n\nthe Court of Appeal.\n\n83. It is of my view that the Appellant\u2019s resort to the appellate procedure does not amount\n\nto an abandonment or waiver of its right to seek judicial review of a jurisdictional\n\ntime-bar in its appeal to the Commissioner-General and reiterated the same in\n\nsubsequent proceedings. That objection was not only recorded but was expressly\n\nacknowledged by the Commissioner-General, who stated in his determination that the\n\n21 [1985] 3 WLR 1090 at p. 1108\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 27 of 28\n\nissue of legal validity was a matter for the courts. This demonstrates that the Appellant\n\nnever accepted the validity of the assessment and preserved its right to seek judicial\n\nreview from the outset.\n\n84. The Respondents\u2019 claim of estoppel cannot stand. Estoppel requires two things: a clear\n\npromise or admission by one party, and the other party relying on it to their detriment.\n\nNeither is present here. The Appellant never accepted that the assessment was valid,\n\nand the Respondents never changed their position because of anything the Appellant\n\ndid. From the beginning, the Respondents insisted the assessment was within time, and\n\nthe Appellant consistently disputed that. There was never any conduct by the Appellant\n\nthat could be taken as an admission.\n\n85.More importantly, the plea of estoppel clashes with the very structure of the law. The\n\nstatute gives taxpayers a strict time-limit as a safeguard against late assessments. That\n\nprotection is substantive, not optional. To say it can be lost just because a taxpayer files\n\nan appeal would make the safeguard meaningless. It would mean that by using the\n\nremedies the law itself provides, a taxpayer could unintentionally breathe life into an\n\notherwise invalid assessment. Such a result would defeat the purpose of the limitation,\n\nand this Court cannot endorse it."

No\n\nchallenge had been made to Kalyanawathi on this point when she was giving\n\nexamination she made the unsolicited assertion that she never signed\n\n17\n\ndocuments in English, a statement clearly inconsistent with her admitted\n\nability to write her name in English, as well as with the evidence of the notary\u2019s\n\nclerk and the receipt P3 signed by her.\n\nMost tellingly, when it was put to her in cross-examination that her denial of\n\nhaving sold the land was false, the Appellant chose to remain silent (see page\n\n325 of the appeal brief). Such silence, when a direct suggestion of falsity was\n\nmade, can reasonably be taken as an implied admission. Her contradictory\n\nstance and evasive responses further undermine her credibility.\n\nIn the totality of circumstances, the evidence of the notary\u2019s clerk stands as\n\ncogent and credible proof of the due execution of Deed No.1530, while the\n\ntestimony and demeanour of the Appellant reveal several inconsistencies and\n\nan absence of candour.\n\nThe Appellant contends that relying on section 68 of the Partition Law that\n\nformal proof is not necessary but genuineness of the deed is impeached by a\n\nparty adversely claiming to the party producing the deed. The Appellant is an\n\nadversely who is challenging said deed. Further, relying on section 25(2) of\n\nthe partition law the Appellants contend that without filing a statement of\n\nclaim a party shall not be entitled to contest or dispute thus impeaching a\n\ndeed means challenging the said deed in the statement of claim and raising\n\nan issue challenging the deed.\n\nIn the circumstances, I am of the view that reliance on the provisions of the\n\nPartition Law alone cannot suffice to impeach a deed without proper\n\nprocedural compliance.

Whether the guarantee bond (P8) was a printed form that had several blanks\n\nthat were filled later with typewritten details.\n\n2. The lease agreement was neither shown or a Sinhala translation was given\n\nto the Appellant.\n\n3. Whether the lease agreement (P2) was lawfully terminated.\n\n1.

His principal argument is that, at the time of\n\nsigning, the bond contained only the printed text and the typewritten details\n\nwere inserted later.\n\n[9] The Appellant in his evidence has attempted to point out to the portions that\n\nwere subsequently inserted. While the precise portions of evidence were not\n\nmarked for the benefit of the Court, a careful reading of his evidence directs to\n\nPage 6 of 17\n\nsuch subsequent insertions to be the date of execution of the guarantee bond,\n\nthe reference number of the lease agreement, the personal details of the\n\nguarantors (entered below their respective signatures), and the name and\n\naddress of the lessee."

He takes up the position that, by\n\nleaving blank spaces in the guarantee bond to be filled later, the lender has\n\nmade a fundamental mistake which makes the agreement void.\n\n[13] However, it is noted that any subsequent insertion ipso facto would not render\n\na contract unenforceable, but rather enforceability would be determined by the\n\nnature of the alteration and the knowledge or consent of the executing party. A\n\ncontract can be vitiated where the insertion constitutes a material alteration\n\nthat fundamentally changes the obligations undertaken, or where the signature\n\nwas obtained by fraud or misrepresentation.\n\n[14] In the present case, it is not disputed that the Appellant executed the guarantee\n\nas surety of the 1st Defendant under the lease agreement. The nature of that\n\nobligation remained constant, irrespective of the fact that the particulars were\n\nsubsequently filled. The Appellant is a literate businessman, and has not alleged\n\nthat his signature was obtained by fraud or duress by the Respondent. His\n\nevidence was that he signed the printed form knowing it to be a guarantee.\n\nPage 7 of 17\n\nFurthermore, the lessee was known to the Appellant, and he has admitted that\n\nhe is related to him."

As\n\nheld in Pigot\u2019s Case (1614)1 it was established that such post-execution\n\nchanges could render an instrument void, the rationale being that no party\n\nshould be held to obligations materially different from those they agreed to\n\nwhen affixing their signature and seal. In its early application, the rule was\n\ninterpreted narrowly and applied strictly.\n\n[16] Over time the courts have refined the principle to reflect commercial realities.\n\nRecent authorities such as Raiffeisen Zentralbank \u00d6sterreich AG vs.\n\nCrossseas Shipping Ltd2, has explained that only alterations which are\n\n\u201cmaterial\u201d in nature will void a guarantee as against a non-assenting party.

The legal incidence of the contract of guarantee (and\n\nindemnity) was not altered by the insertions into cl. 37. The business effect of\n\nthe contract of guarantee (and indemnity), if used for any ordinary business\n\npurpose for which a contract of guarantee (and indemnity) is used, was not\n\naltered by the insertion into cl. 37.

In the present case, the evidence of Belan Daminda is that\n\nthe guarantors were verbally informed of the liability under the lease agreement\n\nbefore signing.

    "chunk_text": "Appellant has signed. He now contends that no translation of the lease\n\nagreement was in fact provided. The Respondent\u2019s witness clarified that the\n\npractice is to furnish guarantors with a translation of the guarantee bond which\n\ninstruments on the rubber stamp appears to be a standard form in which the\n\ninapplicable words were not struck out. Importantly, the Appellant has never\n\nasserted that he did not receive a translation of the guarantee bond itself.\n\nPage 13 of 17\n\n[29] As explained above, the law does not require that the lease agreement be\n\ntranslated for the guarantor, it is sufficient that he understands his\n\nresponsibilities under the bond. On the evidence, that requirement was met.\n\n1.3 Analysis\n\n[30] The 3rd Defendant-Appellant takes up the position that he is not liable to pay\n\nthe demanded sum since the guarantee bond was incomplete at the time he\n\nplaced his signature. The Appellant also contends that due to his inability to\n\nread and understand the English language, he required a Sinhala translation of\n\nthe Agreement, which was not given to him. Under cross-examination, the 3rd\n\nDefendant-Appellant refers to certain numbers in document P8, which he\n\nclaims include the typewritten parts.\n\n[31] The Respondent was obligated to explain to the guarantors the nature of the\n\ntransaction and the liability imposed on them in the event the principal debtor\n\ndefaults. It is evident that the 3rd Defendant-Appellant, as guarantor, was aware\n\nof the amount he was liable to pay to the lessor in the event of any default of\n\npayment of the obligated sum.\n\n[32] The Judge of the Commercial High Court, in the overall analysis of the evidence,\n\nconcluded that the 3rd Defendant-Appellant was aware that he signed P8 as a\n\nguarantor to the 1st Defendant, that the 1st Defendant had defaulted on payment,\n\nthat failure or neglect to pay the sum guaranteed or the return of \u201cthe property\u201d,\n\nthe liability was on the guarantor to pay its value on demand.

I am of the view that this was an appropriate\n\napplication of the principle by the learned High Court Judge. This plea is\n\nprimarily available to persons who are illiterate, sick, or incapacitated. It can\n\nalso extend to an executor of a document presumed to have read and\n\nunderstood the document before its execution; however, by proving that it was\n\nnot the document the executor intended to sign, or that it was obtained by fraud\n\nor force.\n\n[34] Regarding the usage of this principle, Paget on Law of banking states as\n\nfollows3:\n\n\u201cThe doctrine is now rarely invoked successfully, and negligence in failing to\n\nascertain the meaning of the document can prevent its application. So in\n\nSaunders v Anglia Building Society, an elderly widow failed to read a\n\ndocument which she executed in the belief that it was a deed of gift of a\n\nproperty to her nephew, when in fact it was an assignment to a third party.\n\nThe House of Lords rejected a plea of non est factum in a dispute between the\n\nclaimant widow and a lender who had innocently lent money on the strength\n\nof the document.

Weeramantry in \u2018Law of Contracts\u2019 states as follows:\n\n\u201cA person signing a document is held strictly to its terms on the basis that he\n\ndoes so at his peril. This is known as the caveat subscriptor rule, and in the\n\noperation of this rule the principles relating to justus error come into play.\n\nThis rule must not however be viewed as a special head of exemption from the\n\nordinary rules relating to mistake. Where a person deliberately affixes his\n\nsignature to a written contract, the court would naturally be more hesitant in\n\npermitting him to plead that he did so in consequence of a mistake as to the\n\nnature or substance of the transaction, and to this extent would be less prone\n\nto view the error as justus.\u201d4\n\n[36] I also wish to echo the opinion of A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J, in the judgement of\n\nNimalasena vs. L.B.

If he knew that the act of signing a\n\nguarantee would spell for him disastrous consequences of monetary burdens,\n\nhe should have exhibited prudence. So his assertion that he only signed as a\n\nwitness and not as a guarantor does not inspire confidence in this Court. The\n\nnecessity to exercise prudence was emphasized by the House of Lords in the\n\ncontext of the plea of non est factum.\u201d\n\n[37] The guarantors have not pleaded fraud or force when obtaining signatures, or"
