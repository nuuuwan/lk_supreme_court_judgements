 Lordships of the Court of\n\nAppeal by order dated 26.05.1999 allowed the appeal of the Respondent to\n\nproduce the document P4 and set aside the order of the Learned Trial Judge\n\nand made an order for trial de novo.\n\ndated 04.12.2009 answered the points of contest No 1 to 6 in favour of the\n\nRespondent and entered judgment in favour of the Respondent, allocating the\n\nresidual rights to the 1st Appellant after deducting half an acre from the share\n\nwhich she had inherited as matrimonial inheritance from her husband.\n\nAggrieved by the judgment, the Appellants preferred an appeal to the High\n\nCourt of Civil Appeal of the Western Province holden in Gampaha. The\n\nLearned High Court Judges dismissed the appeal of the Appellants and\n\naffirmed the judgment of the Learned Trial Judge.\n\nThe Appellant is before this Court challenging the judgment of the High Court\n\nof Civil Appeals holden in Gampaha. This Court by Order date 07.12.2017\n\ngranted Leave to Appeal on the questions of law, namely \u201cWhether the Deed\n\n9\n\nmarked P2 has been established in terms of Section 68 of the Partition\n\nLaw read along with Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance?\u201d\n\nMy analysis hereafter will be confined to examining the aforesaid question of\n\nlaw based on which leave was granted. The matter for consideration by this\n\ncourt is whether the Deed marked P2 has been established in terms of Section\n\n68 of the Partition Law read along with Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance.\n\nThe Plaintiff gave evidence and thereafter commenced her evidence anew. The\n\nRespondents contended that the Plaintiff has given clear evidence in respect\n\nof the preliminary plan and report and she also gave evidence of the pedigree\n\nand the fact that \u00bd an acre was purchased by her from the Appellant on Deed\n\n1530 when the Appellant had offered to sell the land. Since the notary to deed\n\n1530 had died the Respondent placed the death certificate of the notary before"

Whether the guarantee bond (P8) was a printed form that had several blanks\n\nthat were filled later with typewritten details.\n\n2. The lease agreement was neither shown or a Sinhala translation was given\n\nto the Appellant.\n\n3. Whether the lease agreement (P2) was lawfully terminated.\n\n1. Validity of the Guarantee Bond (P8)\n\n1.1 Whether the enforceability of a guarantee is affected by the addition\n\nof typewritten particulars subsequent to the guarantor\u2019s signature.\n\n[8] The Appellant challenges the validity of the Guarantee Bond (P8) based on\n\nseveral procedural infirmities which should have precluded the trial court from\n\ngranting relief against him. His principal argument is that, at the time of\n\nsigning, the bond contained only the printed text and the typewritten details\n\nwere inserted later.\n\n[9] The Appellant in his evidence has attempted to point out to the portions that\n\nwere subsequently inserted. While the precise portions of evidence were not\n\nmarked for the benefit of the Court, a careful reading of his evidence directs to\n\nPage 6 of 17\n\nsuch subsequent insertions to be the date of execution of the guarantee bond,\n\nthe reference number of the lease agreement, the personal details of the\n\nguarantors (entered below their respective signatures), and the name and\n\naddress of the lessee."

He takes up the position that, by\n\nleaving blank spaces in the guarantee bond to be filled later, the lender has\n\nmade a fundamental mistake which makes the agreement void.\n\n[13] However, it is noted that any subsequent insertion ipso facto would not render\n\na contract unenforceable, but rather enforceability would be determined by the\n\nnature of the alteration and the knowledge or consent of the executing party. A\n\ncontract can be vitiated where the insertion constitutes a material alteration\n\nthat fundamentally changes the obligations undertaken, or where the signature\n\nwas obtained by fraud or misrepresentation.\n\n[14] In the present case, it is not disputed that the Appellant executed the guarantee\n\nas surety of the 1st Defendant under the lease agreement.

The Respondent\u2019s witness clarified that the\n\npractice is to furnish guarantors with a translation of the guarantee bond which\n\ninstruments on the rubber stamp appears to be a standard form in which the\n\ninapplicable words were not struck out. Importantly, the Appellant has never\n\nasserted that he did not receive a translation of the guarantee bond itself.\n\nPage 13 of 17\n\n[29] As explained above, the law does not require that the lease agreement be\n\ntranslated for the guarantor, it is sufficient that he understands his\n\nresponsibilities under the bond.

The Appellant also contends that due to his inability to\n\nread and understand the English language, he required a Sinhala translation of\n\nthe Agreement, which was not given to him. Under cross-examination, the 3rd\n\nDefendant-Appellant refers to certain numbers in document P8, which he\n\nclaims include the typewritten parts.\n\n[31] The Respondent was obligated to explain to the guarantors the nature of the\n\ntransaction and the liability imposed on them in the event the principal debtor\n\ndefaults.

The claimant had known that she was signing a legal\n\nthe trouble to read it so as to ascertain even its general effect.\u201d\n\n3 Paget's Law of Banking (15th edn, LexisNexis Butterworths 2018) 376, para 13.27.\n\nPage 15 of 17\n\n[35] Prof. C.G. Weeramantry in \u2018Law of Contracts\u2019 states as follows:\n\n\u201cA person signing a document is held strictly to its terms on the basis that he\n\ndoes so at his peril. This is known as the caveat subscriptor rule, and in the\n\noperation of this rule the principles relating to justus error come into play.\n\nThis rule must not however be viewed as a special head of exemption from the\n\nordinary rules relating to mistake. Where a person deliberately affixes his\n\nsignature to a written contract, the court would naturally be more hesitant in\n\npermitting him to plead that he did so in consequence of a mistake as to the\n\nnature or substance of the transaction, and to this extent would be less prone\n\nto view the error as justus.\u201d4\n\n[36] I also wish to echo the opinion of A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J, in the judgement of\n\nNimalasena vs. L.B.

The witness came through as a man of the\n\nworld who could not have been so naive as to be unaware of the implications\n\nof placing one's signature to a guarantee. If he knew that the act of signing a\n\nguarantee would spell for him disastrous consequences of monetary burdens,\n\nhe should have exhibited prudence. So his assertion that he only signed as a\n\nwitness and not as a guarantor does not inspire confidence in this Court. The\n\nnecessity to exercise prudence was emphasized by the House of Lords in the\n\ncontext of the plea of non est factum.\u201d\n\n[37] The guarantors have not pleaded fraud or force when obtaining signatures, or"

The nature and the contents of the\n\n4 Law of Contracts 1999 reprint, vol. 1 at page 300 5 C.A.

There\n\nis no evidence that the guarantors were induced to sign the document believing\n\nit to be something different. In such circumstances and taking the above-\n\nmentioned authorities into consideration, the guarantors should be held\n\nresponsible for their actions.\n\n2. Whether the Lease Agreement (P2) Was Lawfully Terminated\n\n[38] It is also contended that by the notice for acceleration of payment dated\n\n17/03/2012, P5, the Plaintiff has demanded that all monies due to the Plaintiff\n\nbe paid within 14 days of the receipt of the said letter. The relevant postal article\n\nreceipt and the seal of the postal authorities are dated 22/03/2012 and\n\n23/03/2912 respectively and are marked \u2018P5(a)\u2019. However, the Plaintiff sought\n\nto terminate the Lease Agreement by letter dated 31/03/2012 (marked P6). In\n\nthe circumstances, it is contended that the Plaintiff has terminated the Lease\n\nAgreement by letter P6, without the lapse of 14 days, and therefore the learned\n\ntrial Judge has erred in law in answering Issue No. 05.\n\n[39] Issue No. 05, raised in the Commercial High Court was limited to the question\n\n\u201cwhether the lease agreement marked \u2018A\u2019 terminated\u201d [Emphasis added],\n\nto which the court answered correctly as \u2018yes\u2019. In addition, the purported lapse\n\non the part of the Respondent was not pleaded before the Commercial High\n\nCourt, nor was it put in cross-examination or pleaded in the Petition of Appeal\n\nto this Court; therefore, it attracts no merit."
