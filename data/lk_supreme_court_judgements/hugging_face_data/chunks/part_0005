    "chunk_text": "that the question of prescription is a matter that has been waived off by the\n\nconduct of the plaintiff, and a matter that cannot be taken up for the first\n\ntime at the hearing of this appeal, although a question of law has been raised\n\nbefore this Court in that regard.\n\nLaesio Enormis, the delay and the conduct of the party who claims benefits\n\nunder the principle of Laesio Enormis is very much a relevant factor. The\n\ndefendants who claimed the benefit of Laesio Enormis have not initiated any\n\nlegal proceedings on such a basis until they were required to file an answer\n\nto the plaint preferred by the plaintiff, which was a claim made more than 6\n\nyears after the execution of the deed marked P-03. Under such circumstances,\n\nI am of the view that the defendants were not entitled to take up such a\n\nPage 16 of 19\n\nposition since they have not gone before a Court of law seeking a remedy\n\nwithout undue delay.\n\nIt is also a well settled principle of law that a plea of Laesio Enormis is not\n\navailable against a subsequent purchaser of the land, but a claim that can\n\nonly be made against the person who purchased the land from the original\n\nvendor. The plaintiff of the action is not a person who purchased the land\n\nfrom the original vendor, but a third party who purchased it from the heirs of\n\nthe original owner. The plaintiff has had no connection whatsoever to the\n\noriginal transaction where the benefit of Laesio Enormis had been claimed by\n\nthe defendants.\n\nThis question as well as the question of delay in claiming reliefs in terms of\n\nthe principle of Laesio Enormis was well considered in the case of Podi Menika\n\nVs. Heen Menike (2004) 3 SLR 289, where it was held,\n\n1. The principle of Roman-Dutch law is to remedy injustice caused to a\n\nseller of a thing due to his ignorance or lack of knowledge. This principle\n\ncould not apply to a situation where the seller was aware of the true\n\nvalue of the property at the time of execution of the deed."

The principle of Laesio Enormis is available\n\nas against a transferee of a deed and not against a 3rd party who had\n\nbecome entitled to the property on a deed granted by the transferee.\n\nPer Dissanayake, J.,\n\nLaesio Enormis has been described by Grotius as: if the seller or\n\npurchaser has been prejudiced in the price to the extent of more than half\n\nthe real value, even though no fraud has been perpetrated on either side\n\nthe party so prejudiced may give the other the option of either cancelling\n\nthe sale or of increasing or reducing the price in accordance with the real\n\nvalue. This mode of restitution applies to almost all contracts.

The principle of Laesio Enormis is available as against a\n\ntransferee of a deed and not against a third party who had become\n\nentitled to the property on a deed granted by the transferee.\n\nIn the case of Jayawardene Vs.

Amarasekara 15 NLR 280, which was a\n\ncase where the principle of Laesio Enormis was considered;\n\nPer Lascelles, C.J.,\n\nIt is clear to me that the plaintiff cannot possibly succeed on her claim to\n\nlearned District Judge that the evidence by which it is sought to prove\n\nthat the lands were sold for less than half their true value is far from\n\nconvincing. But even assuming this to have been proved, the plaintiff\n\nwould not necessarily be entitled to the benefit of the doctrine of enormis\n\nlaesio. It is not the law that where a proprietor, who is in a position to\n\nknow the value of his property, sells it for less than half of what is\n\nafterwards held to be its true value, he is entitled to come into Court and\n\nclaim rescission.\n\nIn the case of Menik Ethana Vs. Kiri Appu 29 NLR 381, it was held;\n\nAt the trial the appellant did not press the question of the trust. There\n\nwas therefore only the claim on the grounds of laesio enormis, and the\n\nlearned District Judge held that such a claim would not be made as the\n\nPage 18 of 19\n\nappellant did not allege that she was not aware of the real value of the\n\nland, and, further, that on the averments in the plaint there was sufficient\n\nconsideration. He therefore dismissed the action. The appeal is from this\n\njudgment.\n\nThe judgment of the learned District Judge is right. The transaction as it\n\nwas described in the plaint was not a sale; according to the sale no sum\n\nof Rs. 300/- passed, nor apparently was it intended to passed; it was a\n\ntransfer in trust for the appellant, and the doctrine of laesio enormis has\n\nno application in such a case.\n\nThe above line of authority clearly establishes that to claim Laesio Enormis,\n\nthe person who sells the land to another must have the intention to sell the\n\nland, but due to the facts and the circumstances, the seller could not have\n\nknown the true value of the land. It has to be established that as a result, he\n\nsold it for less than half of its actual value."

He had been paid EPF, ETF and gratuity.\n\nBut as his pension had not been paid as anticipated by the appellant, he had lodged an appeal in the Labor Commissioner by his letter dated 30.11.1995. (A73)\n\n6\n\nAs the matter had not been resolved at the Labor Commissioner, the Minister had referred the matter to an arbitrator to decide whether the appellant should be granted pension rights for his services to the bank for the period of 11.09.1972 to 19.07.1995.\n\nThe arbitrator, the 4th respondent, had held upon an inquiry that the appellant was entitled for full pension rights from 1995, inclusive of all arrears, which should be deposited with the Labor Commissioner and had proceeded to gazette the said award."

The Plaintiff asserts that although Section 93 of the CPC\n\nwas amended by Act No. 9 of 1991 with the introduction of Section 93(2) regarding the\n\namendment of pleadings, other relevant sections, namely Sections 18, 21, 146, 148, and\n\n149 of the CPC, remain unchanged. Therefore, he contends that in addition to evaluating\n\namendments under Section 93, courts can also consider the implications of these sections\n\nwhen a party applies to amend pleadings.\n\nI must now explore the evolution of Section 93 of the CPC and its applicability. Section\n\n93 was repealed and replaced by a new provision under the Civil Procedure Code"

Section\n\n93 was repealed and replaced by a new provision under the Civil Procedure Code\n\nAct No. 8 of 2017 replaced the words first fixed for trial in subsections (1) and (2) with\n\nthe words first fixed for Pre-Trial. Subsequently, the Civil Procedure Code\n\n(Amendment) Act No. 29 of 2023 further amended subsections (1) and (2) by substituting\n\nthe words first fixed for Pre-Trial of the action with the words first fixed for Pre-Trial\n\nconference of the action.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Plaintiff filed the original Plaint on 05.05.2016. The first Amended\n\nPlaint was filed on 25.07.2017, followed by the second Amended Plaint on 14.09.2017.\n\nOn 01.06.2018, the District Court reserved its Order, concerning the Defendants\n\nobjections to the second Amended Plaint, until 11.07.2018. Consequently, it is necessary\n\nto determine whether the provisions of Section 93, as amended by Act No. 8 of 2017, apply\n\nto this case. The Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 08 of 2017 was certified on\n\n07.06.2017. Section 17 of this Amendment Act, which addresses pending actions subject\n\nto the Act, states as follows:\n\nAll actions and matters which have been filed in the District Court but in respect\n\nof which no date has been fixed for trial shall also be subject to the provisions of as\n\non the date of coming into operation of this Act.\n\nIn light of the above chronology of events, I take the view that the questions concerning\n\nthe said Section 93 in the instant case should be resolved based on the provisions that\n\nPage 7 of 10\n\nexisted immediately before the said Amendment Act No. 8 of 2017.

Such inquiries must be conducted\n\nconsistently with the principles of natural justice and requirements of fairness.

On the other hand, if the document is, take for instance, a\n\nDeed pleaded in the plaint but no issue has been raised disputing the Deed, the\n\nDefendant cannot make a routine application to mark it subject to proof when it is\n\nmarked in evidence.

It misapplies or misinterprets the law in reaching a\n\ndecision on leave and licence as well as on the principles relating to approbation and\n\nreprobation (the terms used by the learned High Court Judge). Based on the foregoing\n\nreasons, I agree only with the analysis regarding jus retentionis and the corresponding\n\nportion of the High Court Judgment that varied the District Courts decision. However, I\n\nam unable to accept the other component of the Judgement of the High Court, particularly\n\nits conclusions regarding whether the Plaintiff occupied the property under a leave and\n\nlicense granted by the Defendant. Considering the totality of evidence and circumstances,\n\nI answer the 1st question of law in the affirmative.\n\nIs ownership of a licensor irrelevant to eject an overholding licensee?\n\nThe learned District Judge recognized that the Defendant was the true owner of the subject"

Discussing the question of lack of any 'ius\n\nin re' in Landlord and Tenant (Lake House Publishers, pp. 215-223), Prof. G. L.

In such actions, the title is presumed to be with the\n\nplaintiff.\n\nPut differently, the defendant in such actions cannot frustrate the plaintiff's action on the basis\n\nthat the plaintiff is not the owner of the property.\n\nThe present action is not a rei vindicatio action proper but a declaration of title action. Hence,\n\nthe High Court is clearly wrong to have set aside the judgment of the District Court on the\n\nbasis that the plaintiff does not have title to the entirety of the land but only to 11/12 shares\n\nof the land."

No question of title can\n\npossibly arise on the pleadings in this case, because, as the defendant-respondent has stated in\n\ntitle of the plaintiff-appellant. It is an inflexible rule of law that no lessee or licensee will ever\n\nbe permitted either to question the title of the person who gave him the lease or the licence or\n\nthe permission to occupy or possess the land or to set up want of title in that person, i.e. of the\n\nperson who gave the licence or the lease. That being so, it is superfluous, in this action, framed\n\nas it is on the basis that the defendant-respondent is a licensee, to seek a declaration of title.\n\nDrawing on the precedents set forth in the referenced judgments, it is firmly established\n\nthat when a claimant initiates an action based on a leave and license or landlord-tenant\n\nrelationship, and proves that he is the licensor or landlord while the other party is his\n\nlicensee or tenant, the claimant is entitled to eject the said other party in possession,\n\nregardless of whether he owns the property. Thus, I will answer the 2nd question of law in\n\nthe affirmative.\n\nShould the High Court have granted the relief of ejectment of the Respondent as a lesser relief in\n\nall?\n\nThe Defendant contends that the learned High Court Judge should have at least granted\n\nthe lesser relief of ejectment, even if the declaration of title sought in the Amended\n\nAnswers prayer was not awarded for some reason. The Defendant further argues that the\n\nHigh Court should have allowed the ejectment of the Plaintiff, as the Defendants\n\ncrossclaim was premised on the leave and license granted to the Plaintiff. The Defendant,\n\nin seeking a declaration of title, contends that such a declaration does not confer additional\n\nrights on the licensor but is rooted in the contractual relationship, confirming that the\n\nlicensee cannot dispute the licensors title that permitted possession."

Although the\n\nDefendant did not present this notice as evidence during the Trial, an issue (particularly\n\nissue No. 26) was formulated to confirm that the Defendant had sent an eviction notice as\n\nreferenced in paragraph 7(h) of the Amended Answer.

In fact, he\n\nhas impliedly acknowledged the same.\n\nFailure to give notice in terms of Section 48 of the Bills of Exchange Ordinance\n\nSection 48 reads thus;\n\n48.

So also\n\nin all cases where the plaintiff relies upon the fact that notice of dishonour had\n\nbeen dispensed with, the matter of excuse or dispensation is a material fact\n\nand must be averred whether in the statement of claim (Burgh v.\n\nLegge5(1839) 5 M. & W. 418) or in a special indorsement (Fruhauf v.\n\n3610 N.L.R. 228.\n\n3723 N.L.R.509.\n\n3874 N.L.R. 255 at page 259-260.\n\nSC/APPEAL/0085/202325\n\nGrosvenor6(1892) 61 L.

With particular\n\nreference to the special procedure of proceedings by specially indorsed writ,\n\ncorresponding broadly with summary procedure upon liquid claims under our\n\nlaw, Byles observes (Byles on Bills, 21st ed., p. 344) that where proceedings in\n\nthe High Court are instituted by specially 'indorsed writ under Order 3, Rule\n\n6, the special indorsement must aver performance of the conditions necessary\n\nto entitle the plaintiff to payment, such as presentment, protest and notice of\n\ndishonour or the excuses for non-performance, in default of which the plaintiff\n\nwould not be entitled to summary judgment. Reference may also be made to\n\nthe Appendices to the Rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, Part V, Appendix C of\n\nwhich contains specimen statements of claim which may be likened to those\n\nappearing in our Civil Procedure Code.

She testified that Juliana had six children\n\nnamely Agonis, Julius, Peso Hamy, Issan Appu, Elo Hamy and Agostinu.\n\nHowever, the learned trial judge considered the contents of deed No. 1337 which was\n\nexecuted by Agostinu in 1957. According to this deed, Agostinu transferred the balance\n\n1/8 share he had subsequent to the execution of deed No. 366 and his maternal\n\ninheritance of 1/16th share from Juliana to Nelo Nona who then became entitled to a total\n\nof 3/16 shares of the corpus. Earlier, Agostinu had by deed No. 366, transferred share\n\nof share (1/8 share) to Piyadasa, who is the predecessor in title of the Respondents.

Even after such rescheduling, the respondents contend that only Rs. 13 million was released and not the Rs. 38 million as claimed.\n\nHence, the onus is on the appellant to show that the entirety of the monies, as alleged, was released to the respondents.\n\nIt is further observed that although the agreements marked as P1 and P2 enables the appellant to charge the respondent the bank rates of 22% plus the interest rate of 6.5% as stated in the agreement, the appellant has also charged an interest rate for default payment, which the respondent contends is illegal. It has to be noted that the alleged loan agreement has been signed by both parties and it has said that the appellant can charge an additional interest rate of 3% in the event of dishonoring the agreement.\n\nNevertheless, upon perusing the evidence led at the trial and the documents marked and produced, it has to be noted that the appellant has failed to produce any evidence or documentation to establish that the loan amount or the rescheduled was ever transferred to the respondents.\n\nHowever, there are documents confirming that the loan agreement took place and that both parties signed and that there was rescheduling and some securities offered but there is nothing to say that the monies have transferred."

Arbitrary and discriminatory treatment by the 1st and 2nd Respondents in investigating the complaint made by the 3rd Respondent. ii. Investigation was biased, driven by the animosity of the 3rd Respondent. iii. This investigation caused public humiliation and distress. iv. Failure by the police to take action on her complaints against the 3rd Respondent amounts to a denial of equal protection of the law.\n\nThe 1st and 2nd Respondents deny any violation of the fundamental rights and that they acted in compliance with the Police Ordinance and the Criminal Procedure Code upon receiving a complaint of a serious nature. It was stated that the Petitioner was summoned on multiple occasions to record a statement but initially failed to appear. The 1st and 2nd Respondents assert that the case was withdrawn upon receipt of the Government Analysts report, the Petitioner was discharged and their actions were lawful, non-arbitrary, and consistent with\n\nPage 7 of 8\n\nthe duties imposed on the police, thereby not violating the Petitioners rights under Article 12(1).\n\nThe above view was reiterated in R.D. Shetty v International Airport Authority (1979) 3 SCC 489:\n\nThe principle of reasonableness and rationality which is legally as well as philosophically an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness is protected and it must characterize every State action, whether it be under authority of law or in exercise of executive power without making of law."

    "chunk_text": "The principle of reasonableness and rationality which is legally as well as philosophically an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness is protected and it must characterize every State action, whether it be under authority of law or in exercise of executive power without making of law.\n\nIn the determination of The Special Goods and Services Tax Bill (SC/SD/1-9/2022, page 36), it was held:\n\nAbsolute and unfettered discretion being vested in an officer of the Executive is a recipe for (i) unreasonable and arbitrary decision making, (ii) abuse of power, (iii) corruption, and (iv) the roadway to depredation of the Rule of Law. On all such accounts, it results in an infringement of Article 12(1) of the Constitution which guarantees equal protection of the law.\n\nThe Petitioners claims of unequal treatment under Article 12(1) must be assessed in the context of whether the Respondents conduct was arbitrary, unreasonable, or discriminatory. Equality before the law does not preclude the investigation of complaints made against individuals provided such investigations are conducted within the parameters of law and without malice or discrimination.\n\nThe allegations against the Petitioner stem primarily from the animosity of the 3rd Respondent and the personal disputes arising from the alleged loan transaction. The record reflects that the 1st and 2nd Respondents acted out of the scope of their lawful authority by making an application seeking further directions from the Learned Magistrate against the Petitioner, suppressing the directions given by the National Police Commission and by continuing to summon the Petitioner to the Thihagoda police and Mediation Board despite the directions given by the National Police Commission. The Petitioner states that these actions are unreasonable, capricious, which amounts to a violation of Fundamental Rights.\n\nPage 8 of 8"

However, the Plaintiff did not assert a prescriptive title to the\n\ncorpus in the plaint. Instead, he relied solely upon the deeds produced in evidence and\n\nthe principles of intestate succession.

Alternate\n\nrelief is given by section 12 which empowers any person claiming to be\n\nthe owner of a land to institute action against the State for the vindication\n\nof his title within 6 months from the date of the order of ejectment and\n\nsection 13 is to the effect that where action is instituted by a person, if a\n\ndecision is made in favor of that person, he will be entitled to recover\n\nPage 14 of 14\n\nreasonable compensation for the damage sustained by reason of his\n\nhaving been compelled to deliver possession of such land.\n\nIt is my considered view that the appellants who are seeking to claim\n\nownership of the land have the option of going before a competent Court,\n\nwhere the said Court could have gone into their claim of ownership, and the\n\nclaim of the State in terms of the Land Reform Law in deciding the matter.\n\nApart from the above remedy, the petitioners will also have the remedy of filing\n\naction against the State in terms of section 12 of the State Land (Recovery of\n\nPossession) Act even if they were ejected from the land.\n\nFor the reasons as considered as above, I am of the view that there needs no\n\ndisturbance of the judgment pronounced by the Court of Appeal in this\n\nregard.\n\nAccordingly, I answer all the questions of law in the negative.\n\nThe appeal is dismissed as I find no merit in the same.\n\nThe appellants shall pay Rs. 50,000/- as costs to the respondent-\n\nrespondents.\n\nJudge of the Supreme Court\n\nP. Padman Surasena, C.J.\n\nI agree.\n\nChief Justice\n\nJanak De Silva, J.\n\nI agree.\n\nJudge of the Supreme Court"

He must\n\nmake out that not only he had been treated differently from others, but\n\nhe had been so treated from persons similarly placed without any\n\nreasonable basis and such differential treatment is unjustifiably made.\n\nIn the present case, the Department of Prisons had used the procedure of\n\nconducting a written examination through the Department of Examinations\n\nin order to select those who are entitled to be promoted based on the marks\n\nobtained by each of the candidates who sat for the exam.\n\nThis has been the procedure adopted by the Department of Prisons and there\n\nis no evidence to suggest that the respondents had deviated from the said\n\nprocedure when determining the successful candidates who stand promoted.\n\nFor the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that there is no basis\n\nfor the petitioners as well as the added respondents to succeed in relation to\n\ntheir applications on the basis that the fundamental rights guaranteed to\n\nthem in terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution had been infringed.\n\nAccordingly, I hold that there had been no violation of the fundamental rights\n\nof the petitioners and, hence, the application is dismissed for want of any\n\nmerit.\n\nPage 26 of 26\n\nThe Registrar of the Court is directed to return the originals of the answer\n\nscripts and the mark sheets tendered to the Court in relation to the"

Section 207 accordingly makes the\n\njudgment of the Court conclusive not only as to matters actually pleaded, put\n\nin issue, and tried and decided, but also to matters which might, and\n\ndecided.\n\n[29] In the above case Wendt J. illustrated the effect of Section 207 CPC with the\n\nexample of a party holding two titles to the same land. If he sues on one and is\n\ndefeated, he cannot later sue on the other; equally, if he is sued in ejectment\n\nand defends on one title only, he cannot afterwards assert the other. His\n\nLordship explained that the Code requires all claims and defenses relating to\n\nthe same subject matter to be raised and determined in a single action, so that\n\neach case, once begun, is absolutely decisive of the rights of parties.\n\n[30] The circumstances in the example given in Baban Appu and in the present case\n\nare not identical, but they rest on the same principle. In that, it was the litigant\n\nwho attempted to divide his rights, withholding one title and then seeking to\n\nassert it in a later action. In the present case, the Plaintiff-Respondent pleaded\n\nhis cause of action on the basis of Constructive Trust. However, the District\n\nCourt, while accepting that the Plaintiff-Respondent had proved his title by\n\nDeed No. 4455 and that the Defendant-Appellant was in unlawful possession,\n\ndismissed the action on the ground that the trust as pleaded was not\n\nestablished. The effect of this reasoning is to compel the Plaintiff-Respondent\n\nto institute a further action based on title to obtain the relief of ejectment,\n\ndespite those matters having already been tried and determined. Both\n\nsituations involve the fragmentation of a single subject matter into multiple\n\nsuits. Whether the division is attempted by a party who sues or results from the\n\nP a g e 14 | 15\n\nprocedural approach adopted by the Court, the consequence leads to\n\nmultiplicity of actions, which Baban Appus case discourages."

Whether the division is attempted by a party who sues or results from the\n\nP a g e 14 | 15\n\nprocedural approach adopted by the Court, the consequence leads to\n\nmultiplicity of actions, which Baban Appus case discourages.\n\nCement Company9 Aluwihare J. stated:\n\nRules of procedure have to be interpreted, keeping in view the concept of\n\njustice as well as to see that multiplicity of proceedings is avoided. If Parties\n\nwere allowed to file distinct actions pertaining to the same subjects in dispute\n\nwithout any restriction, this could definitely lead to multiplicity of litigation\n\nconcerning the same dispute and might cause inconvenience as far as the\n\nadministration of Justice is concerned. Permitting separate suits on closely\n\nconnected claims compels duplication of evidence and proceedings, and\n\namounts to an abuse of the process of Court.\n\n[32] In the present case, the District Court has determined the title of the Plaintiff-\n\nRespondent and the unlawful possession of the Defendant-Appellant. In the\n\ncircumstances of the Plaintiff respondent should not be denied relief in terms\n\nof sub-paragraph b to the prayer granting an order for ejectment for the\n\nDefendant-Appellant. To require a fresh action for ejectment would amount to\n\nduplication of proceedings.\n\n[33] The 3rd question of law is a consequential issue raised by the Plaintiff-\n\nRespondent was not pursued.\n\n9 SC CHC Appeal No. 22/2014, S.C. Minutes of 12.01.2023\n\nP a g e 15 | 15\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[34] In all the above circumstances, the questions of law Nos. 1 and 2 stated\n\nearlier in this Judgment are answered in the negative. The impugned Order\n\ndated 28/02/2017 delivered by the Civil Appellate High Court is affirmed,\n\nand the Judgment of the District Court is set aside.\n\n[35] The Appeal is dismissed. The Plaintiff-Respondent is entitled to costs in the\n\nCivil Appellate High Court and in this Court.\n\nJudge of the Supreme Court\n\nJanak De Silva, J.\n\nI agree\n\nJudge of the Supreme Court\n\nSampath B.

Clause 5E in\n\nboth P4 and P7 specifically requested the applicants to attach the Board Certification letter\n\ncertified by PGIM along with the application. This is a clear indication that as at the closing\n\ndate of applications, it is a requirement that documentary proof of Board Certification\n\nshould be available.\n\nHence the Court of Appeal erred in applying the ratio of the decision in Dr. Preethi\n\nWeerasekera (supra) to this application.\n\nMoreover, the Petitioner did not seek to impugn either P4 or P7.

    "chunk_text": "Hence the Court of Appeal erred in applying the ratio of the decision in Dr. Preethi\n\nWeerasekera (supra) to this application.\n\nMoreover, the Petitioner did not seek to impugn either P4 or P7. According to the\n\nset aside by a Court [F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. A.G. and Others v. Secretary of State\n\nfor Trade and Industry (1975) A.C. 295; Lord Hoffmann in Regina v. Wicks (1998) A.C. 92\n\nat 115; Lords Irvine LC and Steyn in Boddington v. British Transport Police (1999) 2 A.C.\n\n143 at 156 and 161, and 173-4].\n\nHence, the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the requirement of possessing a Board\n\nCertificate physically by 31.12.2020 is not clearly reflected in P4 or P7.\n\nFurthermore, it is erroneous to consider the requirement of possessing Board Certification\n\nas at 31.12.2020 from the point of time when the applications are considered. Admittedly,\n\nthe transfers for 2021 were to take effect from 01.01.2021. Obtaining Board Certification\n\nafter that date although backdated to 2018 is irrelevant. In my view, the requirement in\n\nClause 5E must be considered as at 31.12.2020.\n\nPage 13 of 14\n\nThis approach is supported by the other requirements in both P4 and P7. According to\n\nClause 01, all posts where Specialist Medical Officers have completed 04 years from the\n\neffective date of transfer order by 31.12.2020 are considered as listed vacant posts. These\n\nare the posts for which the annual transfers were to be made. Clause 04 states that the\n\nannual transfers will take effect from 01.01.2021 although both P4 and P7 were issued in\n\nMarch and April, 2021.\n\nWhen examined from that perspective, the Respondent was not Board Certified as at that\n\ndate notwithstanding the backdating of her Board Certification to 2018.\n\nThis is consistent with the position set out in Clause 6.3.11 of the Medical Service Minute\n\ndated 22.03.2001 which states that those who are eligible to apply for special posts are\n\nonly those who have got Board Certification and not those who are eligible to get Board"

It has been put to witness PW1 that the Appellants were shown to her prior to the identification parade. But she has vehemently declined the same.\n\nPW1 also has said that the interaction between 1A and 3A and between 1A and 5A in her house had lasted for over 15 minutes and during the entire period there had been a bottle lamp burning inside the house and the 1st Appellant has been flashing a torch light. Therefore, there had been ample light and time for PW1 to have identified the Appellants at the scene. This is even made easier for her because the 1st and the 5th Appellant have been known to her before."

Therefore, there had been ample light and time for PW1 to have identified the Appellants at the scene. This is even made easier for her because the 1st and the 5th Appellant have been known to her before.\n\nTherefore, the recognition by PW1 of the Appellants is by no means by a fleeting glance as per the Turnbull principle.\n\nIn the Indian case of Wijaya Bahu Rai v State of Bihar 1997 CRI.L.J.2531 it had been said that where identification was only by way of an earthen lamp that\n\nWhere the only source of light at place of occurrence which was village where dacoity in question took place was an earthen lamp, the identification of accused even in such light would not be a problem for villagers especially when many of dacoits were direct relations of complaint. The visibility capacity of urban people who are acclimatized to fluorescent lights or incandescent lamps is not the standard to be applied to villagers whose optical potency is attuned to country-made lamps. Their visibility is conditioned to such lights and hence it would be quite possible for them to identify men and matters in such lights.\n\nTherefore, in the instant case also PW1s recognition of the Appellants by the aid of the bottle lamp need not be disregarded at all because unlike the urbanized people who are used to fluorescent and neon lights the simple villager like PW1 who had not even gone to school has been used to the bottle lamp burning in the night all the life. A similar decision has also been taken in another Indian case, that is Machhi singh v State of Punjabi AIR 1983 SE 957.\n\nPage 6 of 7\n\nTherefore, I am of the opinion that PW1 had ample light and opportunity to identify the assailants at the scene with her low level of literacy."

    "chunk_text": "Therefore, in the instant case also PW1s recognition of the Appellants by the aid of the bottle lamp need not be disregarded at all because unlike the urbanized people who are used to fluorescent and neon lights the simple villager like PW1 who had not even gone to school has been used to the bottle lamp burning in the night all the life. A similar decision has also been taken in another Indian case, that is Machhi singh v State of Punjabi AIR 1983 SE 957.\n\nPage 6 of 7\n\nTherefore, I am of the opinion that PW1 had ample light and opportunity to identify the assailants at the scene with her low level of literacy.\n\nIn the case of SC (SPL) APPEAL 7/2018 his Lordship the former Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya has held that:\n\nHowever, the process of identification of a person who is known to a witness by name or otherwise is described as recognition as supposed to identification. Situations of recognition are considered more satisfactory than the instances of identification. However, even in situations of recognition the Courts should analyze the evidence of the witness who claims the accused is a known person and examine whether the evidence is satisfactory to bring home a conviction.\n\nIn the instant matter, PW3 has known the 1st, 4th and 5th Appellants for some time and he has identified the 1st appellant by voice and thereafter, he had flashed the torch light at PW3. Therefore, it is my opinion that there had been ample reason and opportunity for PW3 to have recognized and thereafter identify the 1st, 4th and the 5th Appellants taking away the deceased.\n\nThe next item of evidence to be considered is the identification parade held by the police.\n\nIt is PW1 who has identified the 2nd and 3rd Appellants at the identification parade. This identification has taken place after PW1 has had an interaction with the 2nd and the 3rd Appellants for a duration of 15 minutes at the scene which I have decided above is not a fleeting glance."

This identification has taken place after PW1 has had an interaction with the 2nd and the 3rd Appellants for a duration of 15 minutes at the scene which I have decided above is not a fleeting glance.\n\nThe Trial Judge and their Lordships of the Court of Appeal has considered adequately the identification of the Appellants by PW1 and PW3 at the scene of crime.\n\nTherefore, the totality of evidence against the Appellants are considered. It is my view that PW1 and PW3 have placed before the Trial Court credible and cogent evidence which cannot be rejected by mere suggestions made by the defence.\n\nPage 7 of 7\n\nTherefore, on evaluating the weight of the evidence the submissions made by the counsel for the Appellants do not have any merit or worth.\n\nTherefore, I too see no reasons whatsoever to depart from the said decision.\n\nAs such, the main question of law raised in the instant matter is the identification of the Appellants at the scene. As stated above, it is my opinion that the Appellants from the 1st to 5th had been adequately identified. Therefore, I see no reason to set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\n\nHence, the instant Appeal is dismissed and the judgment of the Court of Appeal is hereby affirmed.\n\nJUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT\n\nJanak De Silva, J.

This matter arises from an Appeal filed by the Petitioner seeking to set aside\n\nrelief prayed for in the Petition dated 28/09/2006 filed in the Court of Appeal.\n\n2. According to the Petition, the Petitioner was appointed as a Clerk Grade III at\n\nthe Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka with effect from 03/05/1999\n\n(P1), and was subsequently confirmed in that said post by letter dated\n\n26/01/2004 (P2). She was promoted to Clerk Grade II with effect from\n\n03/05/2005 (P3). Her service record indicates transfers across various\n\ndivisions of the University, including the Finance Division, the\n\nAdministration Division at Homagama and Colombo, and thereafter the\n\nInternal Examinations Division.\n\n3. The Petitioner states that, as she was ill and in a state of depression, she\n\ninformed the 1st Respondent University of her illness on 25/07/2006 via\n\ntelegram, followed by a medical certificate dated 21/07/2006 (P16) with a\n\nrecommendation of one months medical leave. On 27/07/2006, the\n\nP a g e 10 | 17\n\nPetitioner tendered her Letter of Resignation dated 27/07/2006 (P7), stating\n\nher intention to resign with effect from 24/07/2006. This was followed by the\n\nPetitioners letter dated 10/08/2006 (P8) which is the acknowledgement of\n\nthe consequences of resignation.\n\n4. The Petitioner contends that, subsequently, she recovered from her fragile\n\nstate of mind and, upon realizing the potential severity of her action and its\n\nconsequences, immediately submitted a letter dated 22/08/2006 (P9),\n\nseeking to withdraw both her Letter of Resignation dated 27/07/2006 and her\n\nletter of acknowledgment of the consequences of resignation dated\n\n10/08/2006.\n\n5.

In fulfilment of this requirement,\n\nthe Petitioner was formally notified in writing of the legal and administrative\n\nconsequences of her resignation through the document marked R5a.

(2) Where any person alleges that any such Fundamental\n\nRights or Language Right relating to such person has been\n\ninfringed or is about to be infringed by executive or\n\nadministrative action, he may himself or by an attorney-at-law on\n\nhis behalf, within one month thereof, in accordance with such\n\nrules of Court as maybe in force, apply to the Supreme Court by\n\nway of petition in writing addressed to such Court praying for\n\nrelief or redress in respect of such infringement. Such application\n\nmaybe proceeded with only with leave to proceed first had and\n\nobtained from the Supreme Court, which leave maybe granted or\n\nrefused, as the case maybe, by not less than two judges.\n\nAs I have highlighted previously, the petitioners have come before this Court\n\nchallenging the constitutionality of the Cabinet Memorandum No. 10/2015\n\ndated 26-03-2015, and the Cabinet decision taken in that regard on 23-05-\n\n2017. I find that, in their petition, the petitioners have conveniently failed to\n\nmention when they become aware of the said Cabinet decision.\n\nHowever, it appears that by referring to the document marked P-06(A),\n\nwhich is the letter issued by the Inspector General of Police on 18-03-2019"

Nawarathnam and Others (1985) 1 SLR 100\n\nat page 105, it was observed:\n\nThis court has consistently proceeded on the basis that the time limit of\n\none month set out in Article 126(2) of the Constitution is mandatory.\n\nIt was observed in the case of Gamaethige Vs. Siriwardena (1988) 1 SLR\n\n385:\n\nThree principles are discernible in regard to the operation of the time\n\nlimit prescribed by Article 126(2). Time begins to run when the\n\ninfringement takes place; if knowledge on the part of the petitioner is\n\nrequired (e.g. of other instances by comparison with which the\n\ntreatment meted out to him becomes discriminatory), time begins to run\n\nonly when both infringement and knowledge exists.\n\nIt is my considered view that the petitioners should have known that the\n\nCabinet Decision reached on 23-05-2017 will not allow them an additional\n\npromotion rather than backdating the promotion they have already received\n\nto their date of sustaining the respective injuries. I find no basis for one to\n\nargue that fact was not within their knowledge. They would have known very\n\nwell that there was no Cabinet Decision that would grant them an additional\n\npromotion."

The initial view was that mere production of a complaint made to\n\nthe HRCSL within one month of the alleged infringement is\n\nsufficient to get the benefit of the provisions in section 13(1) of the\n\nHRCSL Act [Romesh Coorey v Jayalath (2008) 2 Sri.L.R. 43, Alles\n\nv.

However, the present position is that a petitioner must show\n\nevidence that the HRCSL has conducted an inquiry regarding the\n\ncomplaint or that an inquiry is pending. Simply lodging a\n\ncomplaint is inadequate. [Subasinghe v.

A party cannot benefit from the provisions in section 13(1) of the\n\nHRCSL Act where the complaint to the HRCSL is made one month\n\nafter the alleged violation [Alagaratnam Manoranjan v. G.A.\n\nS.C.M. 11.09.2014)].\n\nd. The provisions of section 13(1) of the HRCSL are not available to a\n\npetitioner who has made a complaint to the HRCSL only to obtain\n\nan advantage by bringing his application within Article 126(2) of\n\nthe Constitution [K.H.G. Kithsiri v Faizer Musthapha, (S.C.F.R.\n\n362/2017, SCM 10.01.2018)].\n\n13. This Court finds that, when the Petitioner filed the initial application dated\n\n30/10/2015, he was fully aware that the jurisdictional requirement under\n\nArticle 126(2) of the Constitution had already been breached. By producing\n\nP9, the Petitioner sought to rely on the statutory exclusion from the\n\ncomputation of time under Section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission\n\nAct, thereby placing the Respondents on notice of such reliance. This\n\nobviates the need for the Respondents to have raised a specific objection in\n\nthat regard.\n\n14. Nevertheless, the Petitioner has failed to establish that an inquiry was in fact\n\npending before the Human Rights Commission. No documentation has been\n\nproduced, and neither the original Petition nor the Amended Petition\n\nprovides any clarification in this regard. Accordingly, this Court holds that\n\nthe Petitioner cannot invoke the protection afforded by Section 13(1) of the\n\nAct. The burden of proving the applicability of the statutory exception lies\n\nsquarely with the Petitioner, and that burden has not been discharged.\n\n15. The legal maxim vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt, which\n\nmeans; the law assists those who are vigilant, not those who sleep on their\n\nrights, applies with full force in this instance. In effect, the law supports\n\nP a g e 10 | 10\n\nindividuals who are proactive in protecting their rights and interests, and it\n\nwill not assist those who are negligent or fail to act within reasonable\n\ntimeframes."

The only allegation made by the Appellant is\n\nthat the Respondent verbally promised to the Appellant that he will vacate the corpus and\n\ndid not vacate as promised.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Appellant had not proved that he had informed the\n\nRespondent to vacate the corpus and thereafter the Respondent promised to vacate the\n\ncorpus. In these circumstances, the Respondent submitted that no cause of action had\n\narisen in favour of the Appellant to institute this action against the Respondent.\n\nHowever, the principle is that where an owner of property sues for ejectment, his real\n\ncause of action is simply the fact that he is owner and therefore prima facie entitled to\n\npossession. In this action, the Respondent is admittedly in possession of the corpus.\n\nIn Graham v. Ridley (1931 T.P.D. 476 at 479) Greenberg, J. held that the cause of action in\n\nthat case arises out of the fact that the plaintiff is the owner and is therefore entitled to\n\npossession, and whether a monthly lease is alleged, which has been lawfully terminated\n\nor whether it is alleged that there is a long lease which has been lawfully terminated, it\n\ndoes not affect her real ground of the right of possession.\n\nGreenberg, J. went on to refer (at page 479) to the following extract from the unreported\n\njudgment in Gordon v.

When an owner sues in ejectment an allegation in his\n\ndeclaration that he has granted the defendant a lease which is terminated is an\n\nunnecessary allegation and is merely a convenient way of anticipating the\n\ndefendant's plea that the latter is in possession by virtue of a lease, which plea\n\nwould call for a replication that the lease is terminated. It is the defendant and not\n\nthe owner-plaintiff who relies on the lease, and if the lease itself is denied by the\n\ndefendant, as in the present case, the allegation of the lease is a surplusage.\n\nThis position has been cited with approval in Senanayake v. Peter De Silva [(1986) 2 Sri\n\nLR 405] where Goonewardena, J., after examining several South African authorities which\n\nhave applied the principle expounded in Graham (supra), held (at page 411) that:\n\nThese authorities, it will be seen, go so far as to hold that it is sufficient for an\n\nowner in these circumstances to make an assertion of ownership to the property,\n\nwithout further statement that the defendant's right of occupation is at an end (if\n\nthat be the case) and upon the proof of such title to obtain recovery of possession.\n\nIndeed, they then demonstrate beyond any manner of doubt, that it is competent\n\nfor an owner who has leased his land, upon showing that the lessee has lost the\n\nright of occupation, to eject him on the strength of his title and that an action so\n\nframed is not misconceived nor that the action should be constituted as one against\n\nan over holding lessee based upon the lawful termination of the contract of lease,"

After\n\nconsidering the submissions of Counsel, the District Court made order on\n\n14.09.2023, refusing the Defendants application.

What is\n\nimportant to note in the imposition of this restriction, the Section 12(1)\n\nonly prohibits a defendant seeking any further time to make an\n\napplication (emphasis added).\n\nIt is clear from the word further contained in Section 12(1), that it is\n\nan indication that the Legislature was alive to the fact that such a\n\ndefendant had already been granted time to do so by the District Court.\n\nThat Court did so by specifying the date which it thought as reasonable,\n\nafter allowing reasonable time period by enabling him to make an\n\nS.C.

The Act specifies the procedure that should be\n\nfollowed in the issuance of a decree nisi as well as to ensure its prompt\n\nservice on a defendant. Particularly, a defendant who was served with a\n\ndecree nisi issued under this Act, cannot present himself in Court at his\n\nconvenience. He is expected to follow the specific procedure set out in the\n\nAct, by which he could appear before Court and, that too after obtaining\n\nleave of Court, in order to show cause against the decree nisi. In order to\n\nillustrate the point, I shall make a refence to the other Sections that set out\n\nthe procedural steps the District Court is expected to follow, in relation to\n\nan action instituted before it under Section 3 of the Act.\n\nAfter the plaint is filed and if it appears to the District Court that the\n\nrequirements of Section 5(1)(a) and (b) have been satisfied, it shall enter a\n\ndecree nisi.

Section 11(1) further requires\n\nthe District Court to specify the said date, after having due regard to the\n\ndistance from the defendants residence to Court. Section 8(1) imposes a\n\nduty on a plaintiff to serve the decree nisi and thereby giving a\n\nS.C.

In that, Court noted that it\n\nwas for this Court to provide an interpretation, whether the word rules in Article\n\n182 (3) of the Code of Intellectual Property should, as the respondent suggests, be\n\ngiven its wider, ordinary meaning, or whether, as the appellant says, it should be\n\ngiven a narrower, technical meaning. Amerasinghe J, before arriving at a\n\ndetermination of this particular issue has considered a significant number\n\nof judicial precedents and quoted them extensively. Of these multitude of\n\nquotations referred them, the principle of interpretation of Statutes, in\n\nrelation to instances where the meaning of a statutory provision is clear\n\nand free from any ambiguity was highlighted.\n\nPollock, J in Miller v.

This is because, Section 11(1) states that the\n\ndate to be specified in the decree nisi as the date on which the defendant is to\n\nmake an application seeking leave to appear and show cause.

It is well settled since the pronouncement of Rustom v Hapangama\n\n& Co., (1979) 1 Sri L.R. 352, that the insistence on the existence of\n\nexceptional circumstances, is a pre-requisite that warrants the exercise of\n\nthe discretion conferred on the Court of Appeal, in favour of a petitioner\n\nwho opted to invoke its jurisdiction conferred by Article 138 of the\n\nConstitution, when he failed to seek an alternative remedy available to\n\nhim.\n\nSection 16(1) of the Act states that no appeal shall lie against the\n\ndecree nisi, which has been made absolute due to the failure of a defendant\n\nto make an application in terms of Section 15(a). However, the Act itself\n\noffers an alternative remedy to a defendant who is aggrieved by an order\n\nmade under Section 12 of the Act. Section 16 confers power on the District\n\nCourt to entertain an application by a defendant, against whom a decree\n\nnisi has been made absolute, if such a defendant satisfies the original Court\n\nof either of the grounds that has been specified in Section 16(1)(a) and\n\n16(1)(b), and he is therefore entitled to have that decree absolute set aside\n\nsubject to imposing security, provided that such an application was made\n\nnot later than one year from the date on which the decree nisi was made\n\nabsolute. Therefore, the Defendant was required to satisfy the existence of\n\nS.C.

The exceptional circumstance on which the Court of Appeal\n\nacted in revising the order of the District Court was the deprivation of an\n\nopportunity for the Defendant to show cause against the decree nisi. In the\n\nprocess of reasoning adopted by that Court to arrive at the said finding, it\n\nhad failed to observe that the reason on which the Defendant could not be\n\ngranted any further time to show cause against the decree nisi was due to\n\noperation of law. Since the impugned order made by the Court of Appeal,\n\nbeing a legally valid order as held by the appellate Court itself, cannot be\n\nconsidered as an error in fact or of any law committed by an original\n\nCourt which could be corrected in terms of jurisdiction conferred by\n\nArticle 138 on that Court. In any event, a situation that resulted in due to\n\noperation of a statutory provision could not be taken as a one that has\n\nprejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice\n\nof a party in terms of the proviso to Article 138.\n\nThus, the question of law on which this appeal was heard, namely\n\n[H]ave the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal given an incorrect\n\ninterpretation to Section 12(1) of the Recovery of Possession of Lease Premises Act\n\nNo. 01 of 2023? is accordingly answered in the affirmative.\n\nS.C.

The Petitioners state that B Report No.17/2018 states that the\n\nPetitioner had assaulted the two individuals who claimed to be CID officials\n\nand that it was on this basis that a case was filed in the Magistrates Court.\n\nThe aforementioned B Report is submitted to this Court marked R 10\n\nand it presents a completely different version.\n\n17. According to the B Report, on the 8th of January one Asath, having\n\nhad dinner had been returning home. Where one Kaleel has stopped him\n\nand his friend Najath stating that Asath was the one who informed the\n\npolice of the possession of cannabis by the individual who was arrested for\n\nthe same on the same day. They had then been assaulted by the Petitioner\n\nand one Siraj Ahamed and taken to a secondary location, a house. They\n\n7\n\nhad then learned that this was the same house where cannabis was\n\npreviously found, and an arrest was made. The aforementioned Kaleel has\n\ntold Asath and Najath had come to this house to receive money. They had\n\nthen been brought to the police. The B Report notes that this is an offence\n\nin terms of sections 314 and 316 to be read in conjunction with section 32\n\nof the Penal Code. The report also provides that the suspects (the\n\nPetitioner, Kaleel and Siraj Ahamed) are absconding and moved for a date\n\nto produce the suspects before the Magistrates Court.\n\n18. I must also note that the Petition repeatedly mentions of a refusal to\n\nissue an arrest warrant to arrest the Petitioner by the Learned Magistrate."

Attorney General & Others (1978-79-80) 1 Sri LR 65\n\nat page 68 Shravananda J. comprehensively interprets Article 12 (1) as\n\nfollows:\n\nArticle 12 of the Constitution lays down the general rule of equality\n\nthat all persons are equal before the law and are entitled to equal\n\nprotection of the law and that no citizen shall be discriminated against\n\non grounds of race, religion, language, caste, sex, political opinion, place\n\nof birth or any of such grounds.\n\nHis Lordship goes on to further analyse its applicability in the following way\n\nin page 69:\n\nThough Article 12 prescribes equality before the law and equal\n\nprotection of the law, it has to be recognized that equality in any literal\n\nor abstract sense is not attainable. Its strict enforcement will, in fact,\n\n9\n\nbring about the very situation it seeks to avoid. The fundamental act is,\n\nall men are alike. Some, by the mere accident of birth, inherit riches;\n\nothers are born to poverty. Some acquire skills and qualifications while\n\nothers are untrained. There are differences in social standing and\n\neconomic status. It is, therefore, impossible to apply rules of abstract\n\nequality to conditions which predicate inequality from the start. Yet the\n\nwords have meaning. What is postulated is equality of treatment to all\n\npersons in utter disregard of every conceivable circumstance of the\n\ndifference, such as age, sex, education and so on and so forth as may be\n\nfound amongst people in general. Indeed, while the object of the Article\n\nis to ensure that invidious distinction or arbitrary discrimination shall not\n\nbe made by the State between citizen A and citizen B who answer the\n\nsame description and the differences which may obtain between them\n\nare of no relevance for the purpose of applying a particular law or"

It must also be noted that the scope of Article 12 (1) has significantly\n\nwidened over the years. Cases such as Wijerathna v. Sri Lanka Ports\n\nAuthority [SC/FR/ 256/2017 S.C.

It\n\nis now well accepted that, the right to equality covers a much wider\n\narea, aimed at preventing other injustices too, that are recognized by\n\nlaw.

To award protection under Article 12 (1) in cases such as the instant\n\napplication, where there is absolutely no material to conclude\n\ndiscrimination on any basis, in my opinion is not only illogical but also an\n\nabuse of Constitutional protections guaranteed by way of fundamental\n\nrights. Therefore, I am of the opinion that, as there are no credible grounds\n\nto conclude discrimination based on political opinion, there is no violation\n\nof Article 12 (1).\n\nAlleged Violation of Article 13 (1)\n\n28. Article 13 of the Constitution concerns the due process of arrest and\n\ndetention. Therein, Article 13 (1) provides as follows:\n\n11\n\nNo person shall be arrested except according to procedure laid down by\n\nlaw. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest\n\n29. In the instant application, two arguments were raised by the Petitioner\n\nin this regard. Firstly, that due process was not followed in making the\n\narrest as the arrest took place albeit summons being issued for the\n\nPetitioner to appear in Court on 13.03.2013 and secondly, that he was not\n\ninformed of the reason for arrest.\n\n30. Regarding the first argument, in the case of Joseph Perera Alias\n\nBruten Perera v Attorney General [1 Sri LR 1992 199 at page 236]\n\nthe following is noted with regards to making an arrest:\n\nThe principles and provisions relating to arrest are materially different\n\nfrom those applying to the determination of the guilt or innocence of the"

    "chunk_text": "the following is noted with regards to making an arrest:\n\nThe principles and provisions relating to arrest are materially different\n\nfrom those applying to the determination of the guilt or innocence of the\n\nproceedings while the other constitutes the termination of those\n\nproceedings and is made by the judge after hearing submissions from all\n\nparties. The power of arrest does not depend on the requirement that\n\nthere must be clear and sufficient proof of the commission of the offence\n\nalleged. On the other hand, for an arrest a mere reasonable suspicion or\n\na reasonable complaint of the commission of an offence suffices.\n\n31. The manner in which an arrest ought to be conducted is provided in\n\nsection 23 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 which\n\nreads:\n\n(1) In making an arrest the person making the same shall actually touch\n\nor confine the body of the person to be arrested unless there be a\n\nsubmission to the custody by word or action and shall inform the person\n\nto be arrested of the nature of the charge or allegation upon which he is\n\narrested.\n\n12\n\n(2) If such person forcibly resists the endeavour to arrest him or attempts\n\nto evade the arrest, the person making the arrest may use such means\n\nas are reasonably necessary to effect the arrest.\n\n32. In the instant application, as per the B Report 17/2018, the Petitioner\n\nwas arrested for commission of offences under sections 314 and 316 of the\n\nPenal Code read in conjunction with section 32.\n\n33. As per schedule 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (No. 15 of\n\n1979), persons who are suspected of committing offences under S.314, and\n\nS.316 may be arrested without a warrant by a peace officer. Therefore, in\n\nthe case at hand, I am of the opinion that due process was followed in\n\nmaking the arrest as the arrest was not arbitrary and was a result of an\n\ninvestigation conducted by the Police following a complaint they had\n\nreceived against the Petitioner.\n\n34.

Therefore, in the absence of a\n\nspecific exclusion, no Court can rule out or restrict the application of any of the\n\n15 4 C.W.R. 257.16 At page 171.\n\n18\n\nIt is important to note that in Perera v. Dingiri Menike17 itself, Basnayake C.J.\n\nallowed the addition of the heirs of the deceased 5th Defendant, who had died after\n\nthe matter was referred to Court even without the filing of an answer. Further, in\n\nGovernment Agent, Sabaragamuwa v. Asirwatham et al 18, cited by Basnayake C.J.,\n\nwhere the land that was the subject of proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act\n\nhad been transferred by the claimant while the reference to Court was pending, the\n\nvendee was permitted to be added as a party. Hence, it is clear that the addition of\n\nparties is not alien to inter-pleader actions.\n\nIn light of the above analysis, I am of the view that the facts of Perera v. Dingiri\n\nMenike19 are distinguishable from the present case and, therefore, do not constitute a\n\njudicial precedent applicable to this matter.\n\nAbove all, when the Charter of Justice of 1801 declared the Supreme Court to be a\n\ncourt of law and equity, it commenced the reception of equitable concepts into the\n\nsystem of justice. Therefore, this Court is mindful that it ought to consider not only\n\nthe black-letter law contained in statutes, but also the equitable principles that miti\u00ad\n\ngate the rigidity of the law when determining a case.\n\nIn this context also, the 3rd Defendant suffered significant prejudice, as the Acquiring\n\nOfficer failed to follow the statutory procedure correctly. Consequently, although be\u00ad\n\ning the owner of the land, the 3rd Defendant was on the verge of being deprived of the\n\nproprietary rights to which he is entitled under the Land Acquisition Act, due to the\n\nabsence of prior notice. Had the Acquiring Officer duly notified the 3rd Defendant, he\n\ncould have appeared at the inquiry."

It is therefore the duty of this Court is to protect and re\u00ad\n\nstore the rights of the 3rd Defendant where they have been infringed. This Court can\u00ad\n\nnot, even in equity, place the derivative rights of the 2nd Defendant lessee above the\n\n17 (Supra).18 [1928] 29 NLR 367.19 (Supra).\n\n19\n\nrights of the 3rd Defendant, who is the owner as well as the lessor of the subject es\u00ad\n\ntate.\n\nConsequently, I hold that the learned District Judge erred in disallowing the claim\n\nmade by the 3rd Defendant, SLSPC.\n\nWhen the 3rd Defendant sought leave to appeal against the order of the learned Dis\u00ad\n\ntrict Judge dated February 24, 2020, disallowing the claim of the 3rd Defendant,\n\nSLSPC, the Civil Appellate High Court of the Southern Province holden at Galle\n\ngranted leave to appeal and thereafter proceeded to hear the appeal.\n\nThe learned High Court Judges also distinguished the facts of Perera v.

In\n\ncontrast, in the instant case, neither the 1st Defendant, LRC, nor the 2nd Defendant,\n\nElpitiya Plantations PLC, both of whom made claims before the Acquiring Officer\n\nfor compensation holds title to the subject land. The learned High Court Judges\n\nobserved that the learned District Judge failed to consider the attributes of property\n\nrights, bearing in mind that the 2nd Defendant, Elpitiya Plantations PLC, is merely a\n\nlessee holding leasehold rights under the 3rd Defendant, SLSPC, who is the owner of\n\nthe property. Therefore, despite this procedural defect, it is clearly apparent from the\n\ngrounds stated above in this judgment that the SLSPC is a necessary party to the\n\nAcquiring Officer\u2019s inquiry."

    "chunk_text": "virtue of his position, serves as the ex officio Chairman of the Interview Board, he is empowered\n\nto make annotations such as the one reflected in the marks sheet (P11).\n\n16\n\nAs outlined in Clause 9.3.7 of Circular P1, the interim list of admissions must bear the signatures\n\ncollective approval of the list.\n\nThe specific text of Clause 9.3.7 of Circular P1 is provided below:\n\n\"\n\n.\n\n(9.3.5\n\n) .''\n\nIt is noted that all members of the Interview Board, including the 6th Respondent - Respondent,\n\nhave signed the interim list P9. This demonstrates that the decision reflected in the annotation on\n\nP11 was also an approved collective decision of the Interview Board.\n\nBased on the foregoing, I am of the view that the Chairman of the Interview Board, or the Board\n\nitself, holds the authority to examine the validity of the Lease Agreement P4, as stipulated in\n\nClause 7.4.2 of Circular P1, even after the conclusion of the interview. Consequently, it is evident\n\nthat the marks awarded during the interview may be subject to reassessment.\n\nAccordingly, the 2nd Petitioner Appellants argument that the annotation made by the 6th\n\nRespondent - Respondent does not represent a collective decision of the Interview Board lacks\n\nmerit. Therefore there is no valid basis to challenge the collective nature of the decision depicted\n\nin P11.\n\nSecond question of law\n\nI will now proceed to address the second question of law namely, did the Court of Appeal err in\n\nlaw by failing to appreciate that the conduct of the 6th Respondent - Respondent was in breach of\n\nthe Rules of Natural Justice?\n\nThe 2nd Petitioner - Appellant asserts that he was not given an opportunity to explain or address\n\nthe issue before the Respondents - Respondents decided to deduct marks and make the\n\naforementioned annotation. The annotation in question reflects the decision of the Interview\n\n17\n\nBoard. If so, it may constitute a breach of a fundamental principle of Natural Justice, namely the\n\nright to be heard (Audi alteram partem)."

The affidavit confirmed that the\n\nlessor typically executes lease agreements on an annual basis.

According to the requirements outlined in Clause 7.4.2 of Circular\n\nP1, such a lease agreement can be deemed valid evidence only if it is valid for a period of one year\n\nfrom the closing date for applications for admission to Grade 1.\n\nThe following is an extract from the relevant section of Clause 7.4.2 of Circular P1;\n\n/\n\n(\n\n.)\n\n./ /\n\n(\n\n) . /\n\n- 04\n\nIn this instance, the closing date for admission to Grade 1 at Richmond College, Galle, was\n\n30.06.2020.

If the content is technical, the presumption is that the technical meaning of the term is the\n\nappropriate one unless the content warrants the wider meaning given to the word loquitur ut\n\n22\n\nvulgus, that is according to the common understanding and acceptance of the term in common\n\npractice.\"\n\nAs a result, Lease Agreement P4 does not meet the requirements to be considered an admissible\n\ndocument under Clause 7.6.2 in conjunction with Clause 7.4.2 of Circular P1 to support the\n\nresidency claim of the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant."

The mother of the 2nd appellant vehemently denied the accusations alleged by the respondent with regards to her asking for broker fees.\n\nUpon the conclusion of the leading of evidence, the learned High Court Judge had evaluated evidence quite clearly and methodically and has concluded that due to the violation of the agreement, the appellants are entitled for the initial payment of Rs. 4 million but as requested they are not entitled for the damages and the legal interest because they have not proved before Court the loss incurred financially and mentally.\n\nBut upon perusal of the evidence, as pointed out above at pages 171 and 196, both the witnesses had referred to the loss incurred and they have been cross-examined also on the same.\n\nAt this point, I wish to draw my attention to the case of I. M. D. Bandara vs The Director of Health and others, SC Appeal 69/2016 by Aluvihare, J, where he has stated that,\n\n\u201c ...although it is understood that legal interest may be provided and in most cases is provided from the date of the institution of the action, as per section 192(1) judges are not mandatorily obligated to grant such relief. The drafters of section 192(1) , being conscious of the myriads of\n\n6\n\nconsiderations before the judge, bestows upon the judge, a discretion in the matter\u201d.\n\nTherefore, the learned judge of the CHC had the opportunity of hearing the evidence led at the inquiry. Hence, it is my opinion that the legislators when drafting the above section had thought it fit to leave the discretion in the hands of the inquiring judge to decide on the entitlement of the legal interest, which in my opinion has to be left at that in this instance too."

This assertion of the\n\nTharindu Dilshan. Both of them conduct various traditional and customary rituals and rites\n\nincluding Bhairava Pooja for a considerable period of time.\n\nPage 12 of 15\n\nAccording to Dokras [Dr. Uday Dokras, Vajray\u0101na Shiva Bhairava worship in \u201cIndia\u201d and\n\nIndonesia1], Bhairava (Sanskrit: \u092d\u0948\u0930\u0935 lit. 'frightful') or Kala Bhairava is a Shaivite and\n\nVajray\u0101na deity worshipped by Hindus and Buddhists. In Shaivism, he is a powerful\n\nmanifestation, or avatar, of Shiva associated with annihilation. In the Trika system\n\nBhairava represents the Supreme Reality, synonymous to Para Brahman. Generally, in\n\nHinduism, Bhairava is also called Dandapani (\"[he who holds the] Danda in [his] hand\"),\n\nas he holds a rod or Danda to punish sinners, and Sva\u015bva, meaning \"whose vehicle is a\n\ndog\". In Vajrayana Buddhism, he is considered a fierce emanation of Boddhisatva\n\nMa\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b, and also called Heruka, Vajrabhairava, and Yamantaka. He is worshipped\n\nthroughout India, Nepal and Sri Lanka as well as in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nThere is symbolic evidence that Bhairava is considered to be associated with warding off\n\nevil spirits. The rectangular blocks of stone which stand on each side of the steps at the\n\nentrance to ancient Buddhist shrines in Sri Lanka are known as Guardstones. Many of\n\nthese Guardstones have Bhairava upon their faces.\n\nNevertheless, it is widely known that Bhairava Pooja is also performed prior to excavation\n\nfor treasure. In this context, the reasonable suspicion the 1st Respondent claims to have\n\nentertained may be justified.\n\nHowever, when other circumstances associated with the incident are taken into\n\nconsideration, this justification disappears.

While the mere association or travel history may not be sufficient to warrant arrest, the existence of credible intelligence-based suspicion may suffice under the PTA, which allows broader powers of arrest.

This was also highlighted in\n\nGoonewardene v.

But infringements of\n\nFundamental Rights committed under colour of office by public officers\n\nmust result in liability being cast on the State.\u2019\n\nIn light of the above, the phrase 'colour of office is not limited to\n\nwhether or not the officers were in official uniform but includes factors\n\nsurrounding the conduct of the officers and the authority given to them.\n\nIn the instant case the acts committed by the errant officers were not\n\n17 SC/ FR/ 157/2014, SCM 21.05.2021.\n\n24\n\ncommitted under the supervision or the orders of a senior officer. The\n\nstate has not in any manner approved nor shall approve such conduct.\n\nIn considering the facts laid before this court the acts of the officers\n\nwere conducted in their personal capacity and not in the 'colour of\n\noffice.\u2019.\u201d\n\nDeterrence is of prime importance in awarding compensation in the context of\n\nviolations of fundamental rights, because the impugned conduct is the very action\n\nthat the framers of the Constitution sought to avoid. However, when a court awards\n\ncompensation against the state, it is ultimately the taxpayers\u2019 money which is being\n\nexpended to make up for such commission or omission on the part of government\n\nofficials."

It was contended that the Court of\n\nAppeal as well as the District Court has failed to give due consideration to\n\nthe relevant case law and the principles laid down as to the ouster and\n\nprescription among co-owners when the case was decided in favour of the\n\nplaintiff, where there was ample evidence before the Court for such a\n\npresumption in favour of the 6th defendant.\n\nThe essence of the submissions of the learned President\u2019s Counsel who\n\nrepresented the 1A and the 5A substituted defendant-respondents and the\n\nother learned Counsel who represented the 2A and 3A substituted\n\ndefendant-respondents was that, the prescription among the co-owners is a\n\nmatter that has to be established by the party who claimed prescription by\n\nstrong evidence of ouster and possession against the rights and interests of"

In the said case, the District Court initially\n\nconsidered the matter based on the principle of res judicata, and the primary question was as\n\nfollows: \u201cCan the Plaintiff maintain the action on the principle of res judicata in view of the\n\nJudgement in case No. P/9228 which has been recorded as an admission by the parties to the\n\naction?\u201d.

Apart from the\n\nemphasis placed in the Evidence Ordinance on the doctrine of res judicata, the Civil\n\nsaid doctrine concerning the procedure on civil litigation, specifically in Sections 24, 207 and\n\n406 of the Civil Procedure Code.\n\nPage 9 of 18\n\nThe said Section 207 declares that \u2018all decrees passed by the court shall, subject to appeal,\n\nwhen an appeal is allowed, be final between the parties; and no plaintiff shall hereafter be\n\nnon-suited\u2019. Whereas Section 75(1) of the Partition Law stipulates that \u2018the dismissal of a\n\npartition action in respect of any land under section 9, section 12, section 29, section 62,\n\nsection 65 or section 70 shall not operate as a bar to the institution of another partition action\n\nin respect of that land'. Accordingly, the 2nd Defendant contends that if a partition action is\n\ndismissed for reasons other than those outlined in Section 75(1), particularly after a trial, it\n\nprevents the filing of a second partition action concerning the same corpus.\n\nThe 2nd Defendant further argues that the said Section 75(1) of the Partition Law, read\n\ntogether with Section 207 of the Civil Procedure Code, provides that all decrees in partition\n\nactions are final, except for dismissals under Sections 9, 12, 29, 62, 65, or 70. It is submitted\n\non behalf of the said Defendant that any other decree under any other Section operates as res\n\njudicata, barring a subsequent action on the same cause of action between the same parties.\n\nThe 2nd Defendant relies on the precedent enunciated in Nandawathie and Others v.

The said Section\n\n79 provides as follows:\n\n\u201cIn any matter or question of procedure not provided for in this Law, the procedure\n\nlaid down in the Civil Procedure Code in a like matter or question shall be followed\n\nby the court, if such procedure is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Law.\u201d\n\nThe Plaintiff contends that Section 79 of the Partition Law provides that for any procedural\n\nmatter or question not addressed in the Partition Law, the procedures outlined in the Civil\n\nProcedure Code should be applied, provided they are consistent with the provisions of the\n\nPartition Law. Additionally, the Plaintiff emphasises that Section 75 of the Partition Law\n\npertains to specific instances occurring before the case reaches the trial or judgment stage, or"

It is\n\nhighlighted that even the said Section 70 of the Partition Law does not pertain to a stage\n\nwhere the case has reached finality.\n\nThe Plaintiff argues that Section 79, in conjunction with Section 75 (which identifies specific\n\nsections allowing further Partition action after dismissal), enables other provisions of the Civil\n\nProcedure Code, such as Sections 34, 207, and 406, to be applied in post-trial scenarios or\n\nafter a judgment/ decree has been issued. It is noted that the Plaintiff\u2019s above submissions on\n\nthe said Sections 34, 207 and 406 of the Civil Procedure Code are on precluding a party from\n\nbringing a fresh action, a phenomenon embodied in those sections. Consequently, the Plaintiff\n\ncontends that Section 79 supersedes Section 75 and Sections 34, 207, and 406 applicable to\n\n\u2018decrees\u2019 issued under the Partition Law, as supported by case law.\n\nAccording to its preamble, the Partition Law provides for the partition and sale of land held\n\nin common and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

The Partition Law aimed at alleviating inconvenience due to undivided\n\nstates that:\n\n\u201cOne reason is, I think, that a partition action has always been recognised as having a special\n\ncharacter, in that every party has the double capacity of plaintiff and defendant. Though in theory\n\nit is merely a proceeding by one or more admitted co-owners against the remaining co-owners, to\n\nobtain relief from the inconvenience of undivided possession, in practice it often involves a contest\n\nas to title-see Lucihamy v. Hamidu [ (1923) 26 N. L.R 41.].\u201d\n\nThe Plaintiff cites the dicta in Marshal Perera and Others v. Elizabeth Fernando and Others 60\n\nNLR 229 as well, underscoring the fundamental entitlement to relief under the Partition Law.\n\nThe court in the said case held:\n\n\u201cThe Ordinance presupposes an inherent right in any person who is for the time being a co-owner\n\nto secure a divided holding for himself or else, in appropriate circumstances, to obtain his\n\nproportionate share in the proceeds of sale of the land. If, therefore, any notion of a \u2018cause of\n\naction\u2019 is involved in a partition suit pure and simple, it is this inherent right of a co-owner for\n\nthe time being which constitutes the \u2018cause of action\u2019.\u201d\n\nAs highlighted above, the Partition Law possesses a distinctive characteristic, and every party\n\ninvolved in such action holds the dual role of both plaintiff and defendant. It is a legal\n\nproceeding initiated by one or more co-owners against others to resolve the challenges of\n\nundivided possession. Based on such unique features, the Plaintiff argues that if a partition\n\naction is dismissed without determining the rights of the parties among themselves, such\n\ndismissal cannot be used to employ the principle of res judicata in a later action by the plaintiff"

It is, no doubt true, that frequently the judgment and\n\neven the pleadings in an action are examined in order to ascertain the questions of fact and law\n\nthat have become res judicata by the passing of the decree. This is done for the obvious reason\n\nthat the decree which states only the relief granted does not show the various questions of fact and\n\nlaw which were put in issue or could have been put in issue between the parties. But where a court\n\nPage 13 of 18\n\nhas to decide a question of res judicata in respect of the shares allotted to the parties in a previous\n\npartition action, the decree alone need be considered as it contains normally all the necessary\n\ninformation with regard to the shares\u201d.\n\nIn this backdrop, the Plaintiff submits that the Partition Law stipulates two types of decrees,\n\nnamely, \u2018interlocutory decree\u2019 (Section 26) and \u2018final decree\u2019 (Section 36) and thus, the stages\n\nenunciated in Sections 9, 12, 29, 62, 65 and 70 of the Partition Law do not fall into the ambit\n\nof an interlocutory decree or final decree.\n\nAt this stage, I need to examine the scope of the trial in a partition action that is stipulated in\n\nSection 25(1). Accordingly, the court shall examine the title of each party and shall hear and\n\nreceive evidence in support thereof and shall try and determine all questions of law and fact\n\narising in that action in regard to the right, share, or interest of each party to, of, or in the land\n\nto which the action relates, and shall consider and decide which of the orders mentioned in"

This umbrella\n\nconcept of functus officio encompasses key elements such as res judicata, estoppel, abuse of\n\ncourt process, the prohibition against collateral attacks, and waiver. When addressing functus\n\nofficio, it is important to recognize that its purpose is to ensure finality while concluding\n\njudicial proceedings. The concept of issue estoppel is regarded as a subset of res judicata. The\n\nconcept of estoppel can be divided into two types: (i) cause of action estoppel and (ii) issue\n\nestoppel. Notably, issue estoppel extends beyond a specific cause of action, preventing the\n\nrelitigating of issues already resolved by a competent court in later proceedings. Cause of\n\naction estoppel refers to a situation where legal claims and obligations between parties, tied\n\nto a specific cause of action, have been adjudicated in a prior case.\n\nThe Supreme Court in Nuwara Eliya District Housing Development Co-operative Society Ltd v.\n\nKelani Valley Plantations PLC (formerly Kelani Valley Plantations Limited) and Another- SC\n\nPage 16 of 18\n\nAppeal No. 70/2015 (SC Minutes of 03.04.2024) has drawn attention to the possibility of\n\napplying issue estoppel not only to civil cases but also to judicial review.

This ensures that litigants'\n\nlegitimate rights are protected, reducing the risk of injustice due to procedural mistakes,\n\njudicial biases, or misapplication of legal doctrines.

The District Court\n\nissuing a partition decree or determining the parties' respective rights, shares, or interests in\n\nthe land. Since the judgment in the 1st Partition case did not address the parties\u2019 rights or issue\n\na decree under Sections 26 or 36, it does not constitute a final determination of the parties\u2019\n\ninterests in the land.\n\nAs evident from the aforementioned judicial precedents, the Partition Law recognises the\n\ninherent right of a co-owner to seek a division of property or a share of sale proceeds, which\n\nordinarily constitutes the notion of \u201ccause of action\" in a partition suit. Hence, I take the view\n\nthat the concept of \u2018cause of action estoppel\u2019 or \u2018issue estoppel\u2019 should not be employed in the\n\n2nd Partition case, as the said case cannot be construed as relitigating of issues already resolved\n\nby the District Court in the 1st Partition case. However, the doctrine of res judicata cannot be\n\nPage 18 of 18\n\ncompletely barred from being employed to partition cases, and its application should be\n\nevaluated based on the specific circumstances of each case, particularly in relation to the\n\nconcepts of \u2018cause of action estoppel\u2019 or \u2018issue estoppel.\u2019\n\nOn a careful consideration of the circumstances of the whole matter, I have come to the\n\nconclusion upon the special circumstances of this case and the unique characteristics of the\n\nPartition Law, the doctrine of res judicata should not bar the Plaintiff from proceeding with\n\nthe 2nd Partition case.

The learned Counsel for the respondent submitted that there was no\n\nevidence to establish that the vehicle was used in the commission of\n\nthe offence. According to the Counsel, the B-report doesn't provide\n\nanything clearly to demonstrate whether the vehicle was used to\n\ncommit the offence and therefore contends that Magistrate's order to\n\nconfiscate the vehicle is bad in law.\n\n12. Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance provides that,\n\n\u201cWhen any person is convicted of a forest offence, all timber or forest\n\nproduce which is not the property of the State in respect of which such\n\noffence has been committed, and all tools, boats, carts, cattle, and\n\nmotor vehicles used in committing such offence, shall, in addition to\n\n9\n\nany other punishment prescribed for such offence, be confiscated by\n\norder of the convicting Magistrate.\u201d\n\n13. It is evident from the aforementioned section that, in order for a tool,\n\nmotor vehicle, cart, or similar item to be subject to confiscation upon\n\nconviction for an offence, it must have been used in the commission of\n\nthat particular offence. In the present case, the accused persons were\n\ncharged under Section 6(2)(a) of the Forest Ordinance for unlawfully\n\ntrespassing into a conservation forest.\n\n14.

In this connection I would like to consider a\n\npassage from 'Interpretation of Statutes by Bindra' 7' edition page 235.\n\n\"It is a well-known rule of construction that a statute should not be\n\nconstrued so as to impute absurdity to the legislature.\"\n\n17.

At the time of the inquiry, the Counsel for the respondent merely\n\nsubmitted that he was unaware of the accused intentions regarding the\n\nuse of the vehicle. He stated that he had no knowledge of any criminal\n\nacts that were to be committed using the said vehicle, and accordingly\n\n11\n\nsought the release of the vehicle on the basis of this lack of knowledge.\n\nHowever, no challenge was raised at that stage regarding the\n\njurisdiction of the Magistrates\u2019 Court.

The evidence of the Respondent is that he got the vehicle from Kuwick\n\nInternational on credit basis on an oral agreement with a view to reselling the vehicle.\n\nI fail to see the relevance of any of these grounds for the Appellant to resist the claim of\n\nthe Respondent. It was not the position of the Appellant that the Respondent had induced\n\nthe Appellant to enter into an agreement by misrepresentation. On the contrary, the only\n\nPage 6 of 7\n\nground on which the Appellant sought to repudiate the contract was that the vehicle\n\nwhich the 2nd Respondent wanted from the Respondent was a Toyota Hiace van but the\n\nvehicle which was provided by the Respondent was a totally different vehicle.\n\nMoreover, the rights and liabilities of the Appellant, Respondent and Kuwick International\n\non the question of agency, is governed by English law. Where the principal is undisclosed\n\nat the time of contracting, the contract is made with the agent, and he is personally liable\n\nand entitled on it [Bowstead & Reynolds on Agency, 17th Ed., Sweet &Maxwell (2001),"

However, it must be noted that the learned trial judge entered\n\njudgment only for the purchase price agreed to by the Appellant and not the damages\n\nclaimed by the Respondent.\n\nFailure to Lead Evidence\n\nAlthough the Respondent led evidence and marked several documents in support of his\n\ncase, the Appellant did not lead any evidence at the trial.\n\nIn Edrick De Silva v. Chandradasa De Silva (70 NLR 169) it was held that where the\n\npetitioner has led evidence sufficient in law to prove his status, i.e., a factum probandum,\n\nthe failure of the respondent to adduce evidence which contradicts it adds a new factor\n\nin favour of the petitioner. There is then an additional \"matter before the Court\", which\n\nthe definition in section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance requires the Court to take into\n\naccount, namely, that the evidence led by the petitioner is uncontradicted.\n\nThe Appellant failed to lead any evidence in rebuttal of the case presented by the\n\nRespondent. No doubt, the Respondent was cross-examined and evidence so elicited\n\nPage 7 of 7\n\nmust also be considered as evidence led by the Appellant in rebuttal of the case of the\n\nRespondent. Nevertheless, such evidence has failed to impinge on the case established\n\nby the Respondent on a balance of probability against the Appellant.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, I affirm the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal of\n\nthe Western Province holden in Colombo dated 21.02.2007 and dismiss this appeal with\n\ncosts fixed at Rs. 1,00,000/=.\n\nAppeal dismissed."

Furthermore, it appears from the script of \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d that Shakespeare contrasts the authority of earthly rulers with the higher virtue of mercy. Moreover, he advances this view by linking mercy to the divine by describing mercy as an attribute of God himself. This in my view elevates mercy above human law and conduct. He frames mercy as a reflection of divine grace, with which I find myself in agreement. 56.

A change can therefore result in arbitrariness creeping into the selection process and affect the outcome of such selection process, and result in the violation of the equal protection of the law that a citizen is entitled to. Where a public authority considers that a change is desirable in order to give effect to a change in policy, those who are to be affected must be afforded an opportunity of expressing their views and concerns relating to such change and why such change should not be applied to them. 10) On the face of it, the change in the marking scheme from P7 to P13 and, more\n\nparticularly the failure to apprise the Petitioner and other applicants of such change can result in the Petitioner being denied the equal protection of the law.

The\n\nlearned Senior State Counsel for the 1st Respondent submitted that four days after the publication of P7, several employees who were qualified to apply including the Petitioner had made written representations to the Chairman of the 1st Respondent [3R1] stating that P7 is a deviation from the scheme that existed until then, and that there are issues with the manner in which marks are to be allotted in terms of P7. They had requested that due recognition be given to the seniority of the employees who are eligible to apply, as they have been stagnating in the same grade for several years. Those who have signed 3R1 have also pointed out that there is a lack of uniformity in allotting marks between the various divisions within the 1st Respondent, and that persons such as the Petitioner who are attached to the Finance Division of the 1st Respondent have lost out from being promoted on many occasions as a result of due recognition not being afforded to seniority. 23) The learned Senior State Counsel submitted further that the said representations in"

    "chunk_text": "learned Senior State Counsel for the 1st Respondent submitted that four days after the publication of P7, several employees who were qualified to apply including the Petitioner had made written representations to the Chairman of the 1st Respondent [3R1] stating that P7 is a deviation from the scheme that existed until then, and that there are issues with the manner in which marks are to be allotted in terms of P7. They had requested that due recognition be given to the seniority of the employees who are eligible to apply, as they have been stagnating in the same grade for several years. Those who have signed 3R1 have also pointed out that there is a lack of uniformity in allotting marks between the various divisions within the 1st Respondent, and that persons such as the Petitioner who are attached to the Finance Division of the 1st Respondent have lost out from being promoted on many occasions as a result of due recognition not being afforded to seniority. 23) The learned Senior State Counsel submitted further that the said representations in\n\nthe marking scheme in P7 was carried out as part of an overall restructuring of the scheme of recruitment and promotion within the 1st Respondent, a process which had been undertaken by the 1st Respondent even prior to the issuance of P7, and that in doing so, the grievances of the Petitioner and several others were considered.\n\n9\n\n25) The learned Senior State Counsel emphasised that the new scheme of allotting\n\nmarks did not seek to discriminate the Petitioner in any manner. I must observe that the Petitioner has not made any specific allegation that P13 was introduced to penalize her or to favour others. Hence, I am in agreement with the submission of the learned Senior State Counsel that P13 was introduced by the 1st Respondent in good faith and not with a view to penalizing the Petitioner or to grant an undue advantage to any other candidate. 26) The second argument of the learned Senior State Counsel was that the Petitioner"

Although the Petitioner has successfully completed the examination in three subjects, the ICASL has certified that the Petitioner has completed all five examinations only on 27th April 2018, which is three weeks after the interview was concluded.

While a prima facie case has been made out by the learned President\u2019s Counsel for\n\n14\n\nthe Petitioner in that regard, I am of the view that even if P7 read together with P11 applied:\n\n(a) the aforementioned reasons clearly demonstrate that the Petitioner was not\n\npromotion to Officer (Audit) \u2013 Grade A7. 44) An expectation on the part of the Petitioner to obtain marks for the Executive Level\n\nCertificate in the absence of her acquiring the necessary qualifications by the date P7 was issued can only be regarded as a mere wish, desire or a hope and would not amount to an assertable expectation that warrants legal protection. Therefore, I am in agreement with the learned Counsel for the Respondents that no prejudice has been caused to the Petitioner by the deviation from P7 to P13. 45) In the above circumstances, I am of the view that a finding that the fundamental\n\nrights of the Petitioner guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution has been infringed by the 1st Respondent is not warranted. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.\n\nJUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT P. Padman Surasena, CJ I agree\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE A.L.

It was also\n\nundisputed that the land mentioned as 4A in the same plan, which is the land\n\nto the South of Lot 4B, is also a land held and possessed by the 1st defendant\n\nof the action. In such a scenario, I find it necessary to consider whether the\n\nlearned District Judge was correct in the finding that the plaintiffs have\n\nestablished the title to the land depicted in schedule B of the plaint.\n\nWhen it comes to the title in relation to the said portion of land as claimed by\n\nthe plaintiffs, they have gone on the basis that their immediate predecessor\n\nin title, namely Premachandra Subasinghe, was the son of Punchi Banda\n\nSubasinghe, who became entitled to Lot 4 of the final partition plan marked\n\nP-02."

As I have\n\nconsidered earlier, this would not give a clear understanding of the disputed\n\nportion of the land claimed by the plaintiffs.\n\nAlthough the Court of Appeal in its determination has not considered the\n\nquestion of the identity of the land separately, it is my view that proving the\n\ntitle as claimed by the party includes the proper identification of the land for\n\nwhich such a party claims title.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I am of the view that the learned District Judge has\n\nfailed to consider the necessary ingredients that needs to be established in an\n\naction for declaration of title, when the matter was determined in relation to\n\nthe land morefully described in schedule B of the plaint in favour of the\n\nplaintiffs.\n\nI find that the Court of Appeal was correct in its final determination to allow\n\nthe appeal and set aside the District Court judgment, based on the premise\n\nthat the plaintiffs have failed to prove the title claimed by them, though the\n\nquestion of identity of the land has not been discussed in any detail.\n\nPage 18 of 18\n\nAccordingly, I answer the questions of law under which this appeal was\n\nconsidered in the following manner.\n\nI. No.\n\nII. Although it was not only on the basis of prescriptive title the parties\n\nhave claimed their rights, it is not a basis to interfere with the Court of\n\nAppeal judgment.\n\nIII. No.\n\nIV. No.\n\nV. No.\n\nHence, the appeal is dismissed due to the aforementioned reasons, as I find\n\nno merit in the appeal.\n\nThe parties shall bear their own costs.\n\nJudge of the Supreme Court\n\nS.

This appeal was heard on\n\n02.11.2022 and as such was pending when the Act No. 17 of 2022 became law.

Documents marked P8, P9, P10 and P11 prove that the Appellant had\n\npaid certain sums of money from this loan.\n\nNevertheless, the Respondent has explained the circumstances leading to the issuance of\n\nP9, which is a receipt issued by the Respondent for Rs. 1800/=. The Appellant sought to\n\nestablish that this reflects part payment of the money borrowed on Deed No. 7216 (P6)\n\nbecause it is dated subsequent to the date of Deed No. 7216 (P6). However, the\n\nRespondent testified that when he conveyed the corpus previously by Deed No. 7113\n\n(D8/P5), the Appellant gave him Rs. 18,000/= which was the consideration in that deed.\n\nThe Appellants wife had conveyed the property earlier by Deed No. 7076 (D7/P4) which\n\nwas a conditional transfer for Rs. 18,000/=. The Respondent conveyed the corpus back to\n\nthe Appellant by Deed No. 7113 (D8/P5) for the very same amount and on that occasion"

Broadly\n\nstated, the answer must be that it takes effect as soon as the case is ripe for\n\nfrom defending the action. Allowing for differences in the system of pleading,\n\nthis answer will apply equally to the Roman Law, the Dutch Law, and the law\n\nof this Colony. In regard to the Roman system of civil process it is well known\n\nthat the mode of procedure underwent great changes from the early times of\n\nRome to the time of Justinian. Throughout these changes, however, it was\n\nalways considered necessary that the time when a contested right was to be\n\nconsidered as really made the subject of litigation should be carefully marked.\n\nIn the time of Justinian an action was begun with the denunciatio actionis, by\n\nwhich the plaintiff announced to a magistrate that he wished to bring an\n\naction. and furnished a short statement of his case. This statement might be\n\noral or in writing, and was sent by the Magistrate, through a bailiff of the\n\nCourt, to the defendant. The parties or their procurators appeared before the\n\nMagistrate, and he then and there decided the case. (...) The litis contestatio\n\ntook place directly the Magistrate began to hear the cause.\n\nIn Holland the mode of procedure was far more cumbrous, and the difficulty of\n\nmarking the exact time when the litis contestatio took place was\n\nproportionately greater than under the Roman system. In summary causes\n\n(such as actions for a decree of civil imprisonment, or for a decree of perpetual\n\nsilence) there was not much difficulty, for as soon as the defendant had\n\nobjected to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the litis contestatio was held to have taken\n\neffect (....), for the Court might then hear and decide the case without further\n\npleadings.\n\nAgain, a kind of fictitious litis contestatio was, according to Voet, admitted"

In ordinary defended cases, however, the rule was that the litis\n\ncontestatio was not complete until after duplicatio was pleaded (...) - Now the\n\nduplicatio or duplique of the Dutch law corresponds with the rejoinder of our\n\nlaw (...) the-litis- contestatio in an ordinary defended suit may be considered to\n\ntake place as soon as the pleadings are closed.\" [Emphasis Added]\n\nAccordingly, in an action where the Defendant appears before the Court, litis\n\ncontestatio occurs when the Defendant pleads. However, in a case where the\n\nDefendant defaults, litis contestatio takes effect at the time of the Defendant\u2019s\n\ndefault.\n\nDespite the fact that the reasons for the original Defendant\u2019s default were\n\nwithin the knowledge of the substituted Defendants in this case, the argument\n\nthat the reasons for the default lie solely within the personal knowledge of the\n\nDefendant is devoid of merit in law. It is a well-established rule that, even in an\n\naction in personam, an heir is bound by his predecessor in interest once the\n\naction has reached the stage of litis contestatio.\n\nOnce an heir is substituted in a case, they cannot alter or modify the position\n\nheld by the deceased predecessor. Proceedings before the Court must continue\n\nfrom the point where the predecessor left them. Procedural rules should not\n\nobstruct justice or legitimize any injustice.

In cases where the decree or any subsequent order directs the payment\n\nof money in installments or the delivery of property on a specified date, the\n\nten-year period is calculated from the date of default in making such payment\n\nor delivering such property.\n\nHowever, as per section 337(2) of the Civil Procedure Code if the judgment-\n\ndebtor has by fraud or force prevented the execution of the decree within that\n\nperiod, the rigidity of this rule is relaxed. In such circumstances, the ten year\n\nperiod begins to run from the date of removal or cessation of such malady or\n\ndisability.\n\nIf the aforementioned statutory bar applies to this case, any consequential steps\n\ntaken following this judgment would be futile.\n\nIn the Supreme Court case of Mohamed Azar v.

The\n\ntime bar will apply in cases where the judgment creditor after becoming\n\nentitled to obtain the writ has slept over his rights for ten years\n\nUnder Section 337(3), which was introduced by Act No. 53 of 1980, a writ of\n\nexecution remains in force for one year from the date of issuance.

While the plaint is silent with regard to delivery, the Defendant took up the following positions in its answer with regard to delivery:\n\nAugust 2006, as per the agreement between the parties, the Plaintiff unilaterally requested for further time to take delivery of the vessel notwithstanding the fact that the Defendant was ready and willing to conclude the transaction at the end of August 2006 [paragraph 37]; (c) Subject to certain conditions and purely as a gesture of goodwill towards the Plaintiff, the Defendant agreed to grant further time and to charter the said\n\n17\n\nvessel to the Plaintiff under the Sri Lankan flag and Sri Lankan crew until the Plaintiff was in a position to take delivery of the vessel.

The second is that the Vessel continued to be under the management and control of the Defendant during the time it was under charter to a third party. The third is that at the end of the said charter, the Plaintiff sought further time to take delivery. The Plaintiff thus had the use of the Vessel from August \u2013 December 2006 on the basis of a charter of the Vessel to the Plaintiff and not because the Vessel had been delivered on approval or sale or return basis. The cumulative effect of the above averments is that the Vessel has not been sold and delivered to the Plaintiff.

Reliance was placed on Siriwardena vs. Air Ceylon Ltd3, where an\n\nOrder was held to be final if it disposed of the entire matter in litigation and left\n\nnothing further for adjudication.\n\n[10] The Defendant-Appellants, however, argued that the Order was interlocutory\n\nand therefore required Leave to Appeal.

They\n\nfurther contended that the application approach, affirmed by a five-judge bench\n\nof the Supreme Court in 2010, is now the prevailing law, superseding the Order\n\napproach adopted in Siriwardena vs. Air Ceylon Ltd6."

Having considered the material placed before it, the District\n\nCourt, by Order dated 26/03/2007, upheld the objection and dismissed the\n\nsecond action on the ground that it was not maintainable.\n\nPage 16 of 18\n\n\u201cI think that the true definition is this. I conceive that an order is \u2018final\u2019 only\n\nwhere it is made upon an application or other proceeding which must,\n\nwhether such application or other proceeding fail or succeed, determine the\n\naction. Conversely, I think that an order is \u2018interlocutory\u2019 where it cannot be\n\naffirmed that in either event the action will be determined.\u201d\n\n[31] As referred to earlier in this Judgment, the first action, bearing No. 19530/L,\n\nwas dismissed by the District Court on 23/05/2003 for non-compliance with\n\nan imperative provision of the Civil Procedure Code. The Plaintiff-Respondent\n\nraised a question of law based on the plea of res judicata through estoppel,\n\nreferencing the Divisional Bench decision Appeal Nos. 101A/2009 and\n\n101B/2009 [SC HCCA LA 174/2008] (Rajendra Chettiar vs. Narayanan\n\nChettiar24). In that case, the learned Additional District Judge dismissed the\n\naction in limine under Section 46(2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

(No. 2)26, Lord Guest\n\nstated, \u201cany party to such litigation as against any other party is estopped\n\nthe merits.\u201d\n\n[33] It is crucial to recognize that when the District Court dismissed the second\n\naction, it did not consider or resolve the rights and liabilities of the parties on\n\nthe merits, nor did it issue a final Judgment. By Order dated 26/03/2007, the\n\nDistrict Court inter alia, upheld the plea of res judicata by way of estoppel and\n\naccordingly dismissed the action. At the time the District Court made its Order,\n\nan Appeal against the Order in the first action was pending before the Court of\n\nAppeal. The Court held that although the Plaintiff admitted to filing the Appeal\n\nand undertook to withdraw it, the Plaintiff had failed to establish that the\n\napplication to withdraw the Appeal bearing No. C.A. 412/03 had been allowed,\n\nor that the Appeal had in fact been withdrawn.\n\n[34] Applying the application approach to the present case, it is evident that the\n\ndismissal of the Plaintiff\u2019s second action arose from a preliminary objection\n\ntaken at the commencement of proceedings. While the decision to uphold the\n\nobjection brought the action to an end, had the objection been overruled, the\n\nmatter would have proceeded to trial, leaving the parties\u2019 substantive rights yet\n\nto be decided. The decisive consideration is whether the Order necessarily\n\nconcludes the litigation irrespective of the outcome of the application. On this\n\ntest, the Order dated 26/03/2007 must be regarded as interlocutory.\n\n[35] Considering all the above circumstances, it cannot be said that the decision of\n\nthe District Court, in dismissing the second action, was final and conclusive\n\nbetween the parties on the merits so as to operate as a complete bar to further\n\nproceedings. Accordingly, I hold that the Order dated 26/03/2007 is not a Final\n\n26 1967 (1) AC. 853\n\nPage 18 of 18"

The Appellant, being dissatisfied, lodged an appeal by letter dated 9th July 2008,\n\nmarked P7 in the brief, addressed to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue\n\nunder Section 136 of the Act, challenging inter alia that the Notice of Assessment had\n\nbeen issued outside the statutory time limit and was therefore null and void. Several\n\nfurther objections were taken by the Appellant, including that the mandatory statutory\n\nrequirement to communicate reasons for not accepting the return had not been\n\ncomplied with prior to the making of the assessment.\n\n13. The appeal was thereafter taken up for hearing before the Department. The Appellant,\n\nby its written submissions dated 8th February 2010, marked P8 in the brief, set out in\n\ndetail the objections to the assessment. The Respondents, by their written submissions\n\ndated 26th February 2010, asserted that the assessment had in fact been made within"

The Respondent\u2019s defence, which hinges on the\n\nclaim that an assessment can be secretly completed and then notified at its\n\nconvenience, is a direct assault on these core principles.\n\n33.

One of the earliest authorities in this jurisdiction is Commissioner of Income Tax v\n\nChettinad Corporation Ltd.

Gratiaen J. explained\n\nthe position in the following terms:\n\n\u201cThe distinction between an \u2018assessment\u2019 and a \u2018notice of assessment\u2019 is thus\n\nmade clear: the former is the departmental computation of the amount of tax\n\nwith which a particular assessee is considered to be chargeable and the latter is\n\nthe formal intimation to him of the fact that such an assessment has been\n\nmade.\u201d2\n\n37. If this notion were to be accepted, it would mean that under the Inland Revenue Act No.\n\n38 of 2000, the Assessor is only required to make the internal computation within the\n\nstipulated three years, while being free to indefinitely delay the issuance of the Notice\n\nof Assessment.\n\n38. But this is not the scheme of the 2000 Act. Section 134(1) specifically provides that an\n\nAssessor may \u201cassess the amount \u2026 and shall by notice in writing require such person to\n\npay forthwith.\u201d The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d makes it clear that the duty to compute tax\n\nliability and the duty to issue notice are inseparably linked. The section treats them as a\n\nsingle statutory act, not as two independent steps.\n\n1 55 NLR 553\n\n2 ibid, at p. 556 (emphasis added)\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 13 of 28\n\n39.

Samarakoon C.J. emphasized that the purpose of requiring reasons, was to ensure that\n\nthe Assessor genuinely applied their mind to the taxpayer\u2019s return and reached a\n\ndefinite determination. His Lordship stated:\n\n\u201cThe primary purpose of the amending legislation is to ensure that the Assessor\n\nwill bring his mind to bear on the return and come to a definite determination\n\nwhether or not to accept it. It was intended to prevent arbitrary and grossly\n\nunfair assessments which many Assessors had been making as \u201ca protective\n\nmeasure\". An unfortunate practice had developed where some Assessors, due to\n\npressure of work and other reasons, tended to delay looking at a return till the\n\nlast moment and then without a proper scrutiny of the return, made a grossly\n\nexaggerated assessment. Under the amendment when an Assessor does not\n\naccept a return, it must mean that at the relevant point of time he has brought\n\nhis mind to bear on the return and has come to a decision rejecting the return.\n\nConsequent to this rejection, the reasons must be communicated to the\n\nAssessee\u2026 His reasons must be communicated at or about the time he sends his\n\nassessment on an estimated income.

This passage highlights two critical principles. First, the giving of reasons is not a mere\n\nprocedural formality; it is a substantive requirement ensuring that the assessment\n\nreflects a genuine, considered decision by the Assessor. Second, the timing of the\n\ncommunication is essential; reasons must accompany the notice of assessment at the\n\nmoment the assessment is sent; failing which, the remedial purpose of the legislation is\n\ndefeated. It is noted that in the case at hand, it was also the Appellant\u2019s position at the\n\nstage of appeal to the CGIR that sufficient reasons were not communicated for the\n\nrejection.\n\n46. The dissenting opinion, notably that of Sharvananda J. (as His Lordship was then),\n\ntreated the communication of reasons as a \"directory\" step, suggesting that an internal\n\nassessment could stand even if the reasons were communicated later. However, this\n\nview did not carry the force of binding precedent, while the majority\u2019s reasoning is\n\nbinding on this Court.\n\n47. As E. Gooneratne clearly sets out in his book \u2018Income Tax in Sri Lanka\u2019,\n\n\u201cMaking an assessment culminates in the notice on the person assessed.

The law cannot permit taxpayers to be held in such\n\nperpetual suspense.\n\n49. The Respondents rely on the English decision of Honig and Others (administrators of\n\nEmmanuel Honig) v Sarsfield (H M Inspector of Taxes),7 first decided in the\n\nChancery Division and affirmed in the Court of Appeal.8 In that case, the issue was\n\nwhether assessments were \u201cmade\u201d within the statutory time limit prescribed by\n\nSections 34 and 40(1) of the United Kingdom Taxes Management Act of 1970. The\n\nInspector of Taxes had signed a certificate in the official assessment book on 16th\n\nMarch 1970, but the notices were only served after 7th April 1970. The court held that\n\nthe assessments were nevertheless in time, because they were \u201cmade\u201d when the\n\nInspector signed the book, and not when the notices were served.

Under the UK legislation, the Inspector was\n\nstatutorily obliged to maintain an assessment register, and the act of signing the\n\n7 Honig and Others (administrators of Emmanuel Honig) v Sarsfield (H M Inspector of Taxes) [1985] STC 31\n\n(Ch D), affd [1986] STC 246 (CA).\n\n8 1986 STC 246\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 17 of 28\n\nregister itself was deemed to constitute the making of an assessment.9 Service of notice\n\nwas a separate obligation governed by other provisions.\n\n51.

The Court, through Wijeratne J., held that, because the letter in that case contained\n\nboth a statement of reasons for rejecting the return and a quantified computation of\n\nestimated income, it satisfied the statutory requirements and therefore amounted to an\n\nassessment made within time. The Court\u2019s reasoning turned on the fact that the\n\nintimation was not a bare notification but a document that in substance, combined two\n\nindispensable elements\u2014reasons for rejection and an explicit computation of income\n\ntax liability.\n\n16 CA Tax 5/2016, CA minutes of 29th September 2022\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 21 of 28\n\n64.

While it contains certain preliminary calculations, these workings\n\ncannot be framed as a final and binding determination of liability.\n\n65.

The Department must act, and must notify, within that time.\n\n68. There is a wider principle at stake, as I noted earlier. Taxation is a compulsory exaction\n\nbacked by the coercive power of the State. It is therefore imperative that the power to\n\ntax be exercised strictly in accordance with law, and within the boundaries the\n\nlegislature has drawn. Time bars in tax law are not technical traps for the Department;\n\nthey are jurisdictional limits imposed in the interests of certainty, fairness, and discipline.\n\n69.

The question for consideration here is whether the Court of Appeal was correct in\n\nholding that the Appellant could not invoke its Writ jurisdiction simply because a\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 23 of 28\n\n73. At its core, this question concerns the proper role of the Court of Appeal in supervising\n\nadministrative action and ensuring that public authorities act within the limits of their\n\nlegal powers. The Constitution, under Article 140, clearly empowers the Court of Appeal\n\nto issue Writs of Certiorari as a safeguard to enforce the rule of law. The mere existence\n\nof a statutory appeal, which ordinarily addresses errors made within the lawful scope of\n\nauthority, does not limit or displace this constitutional power.\n\n74. I find the distinction between acts committed within jurisdiction and acts wholly\n\nwithout jurisdiction is fundamental. Appeals are designed to correct mistakes made\n\nwithin the authority granted by law, but acts performed outside the authority conferred\n\nby statute are nullities. No appeal can cure an action taken without legal power. As held\n\nin D.M.S. Fernando and Another v. Mohideen Ismail, where a similar contention was\n\nraised by the Deputy Solicitor-General, the Court held that:\n\n\u201dThere was another matter that was raised incidentally. It was contended by\n\nthe Deputy Solicitor\u2011General that the Respondent was not entitled to maintain\n\nthis application for Writ because an alternative remedy by way of appeal was\n\navailable to him under the Inland Revenue Act. Those provisions confine him\n\nto an appeal against the quantum of assessment. The Commissioner has not\n\nbeen given power to order the Assessor to communicate reasons. He may, or\n\nmay not, do so as an administrative act. The Assessor may, or may not, obey.\n\nThe Assessee is powerless to enforce the execution of such administrative acts.\n\nThe present objection goes to the very root of the matter and is independent of"

His Lordship further explained:\n\n\u201cAs judicial review is a collateral challenge and not an appeal, it will only be in\n\nexceptional circumstances that the courts will allow the collateral process of\n\njudicial review to be used to attack an appealable decision, when Parliament has\n\nexpresslyprovidedbystatuteanappellateprocedure.Butexceptional\n\ncircumstances may arise when it would be unjust for the taxpayer to appeal a\n\ndecision of the Commissioner \u2013 General.

    "chunk_text": "therefore precluded from thereafter denying its legality, which has been accepted by\n\nthe Court of Appeal.\n\n83. It is of my view that the Appellant\u2019s resort to the appellate procedure does not amount\n\nto an abandonment or waiver of its right to seek judicial review of a jurisdictional\n\ntime-bar in its appeal to the Commissioner-General and reiterated the same in\n\nsubsequent proceedings. That objection was not only recorded but was expressly\n\nacknowledged by the Commissioner-General, who stated in his determination that the\n\n21 [1985] 3 WLR 1090 at p. 1108\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 27 of 28\n\nissue of legal validity was a matter for the courts. This demonstrates that the Appellant\n\nnever accepted the validity of the assessment and preserved its right to seek judicial\n\nreview from the outset.\n\n84. The Respondents\u2019 claim of estoppel cannot stand. Estoppel requires two things: a clear\n\npromise or admission by one party, and the other party relying on it to their detriment.\n\nNeither is present here. The Appellant never accepted that the assessment was valid,\n\nand the Respondents never changed their position because of anything the Appellant\n\ndid. From the beginning, the Respondents insisted the assessment was within time, and\n\nthe Appellant consistently disputed that. There was never any conduct by the Appellant\n\nthat could be taken as an admission.\n\n85.More importantly, the plea of estoppel clashes with the very structure of the law. The\n\nstatute gives taxpayers a strict time-limit as a safeguard against late assessments. That\n\nprotection is substantive, not optional. To say it can be lost just because a taxpayer files\n\nan appeal would make the safeguard meaningless. It would mean that by using the\n\nremedies the law itself provides, a taxpayer could unintentionally breathe life into an\n\notherwise invalid assessment. Such a result would defeat the purpose of the limitation,\n\nand this Court cannot endorse it."

I am of the view that\n\n18\n\nthe section of the new amendment to the Civil Procedure code set out above\n\nthat is applicable to the present case is Section 3 (a) (i) as the Appellant\u2019s\n\ncounsel failed to reiterate his objections at the end of the Respondent\u2019s case.\n\nIn any event, in answering issue No. 5, the learned District Judge has rightly\n\nconcluded that the signature appearing on the deed was that of the Appellant.\n\nI find no reason to depart from this finding, for on the available material,\n\nincluding the corroborative receipt and the absence of contrary evidence, the\n\nRespondent has discharged her burden of proving execution of the deed to\n\nthe fullest extent possible in the circumstances fulfilling the requirements of\n\nsection 68 and 69 of the Evidence Ordinance.\n\nWhen considering all the above discussed circumstances, it is evident that\n\nthe Learned High Court Judge of the High Court of Civil Appeals of the\n\nWestern Province holden in Gampaha and the Learned District Court Judge\n\nof Gampaha have arrived at the correct conclusion and I see no need to\n\ninterfere with their decision.\n\nOn this basis, I decide the question of law in the present case in the negative.\n\nI uphold the judgments of the High Court Province of Civil Appeals of the\n\nWestern Province holden in Gampaha and the District Court of Gampaha.\n\nIn these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, the appeal of the"

Whether the guarantee bond (P8) was a printed form that had several blanks\n\nthat were filled later with typewritten details.\n\n2. The lease agreement was neither shown or a Sinhala translation was given\n\nto the Appellant.\n\n3. Whether the lease agreement (P2) was lawfully terminated.\n\n1. Validity of the Guarantee Bond (P8)\n\n1.1 Whether the enforceability of a guarantee is affected by the addition\n\nof typewritten particulars subsequent to the guarantor\u2019s signature.\n\n[8] The Appellant challenges the validity of the Guarantee Bond (P8) based on\n\nseveral procedural infirmities which should have precluded the trial court from\n\ngranting relief against him. His principal argument is that, at the time of\n\nsigning, the bond contained only the printed text and the typewritten details\n\nwere inserted later.\n\n[9] The Appellant in his evidence has attempted to point out to the portions that\n\nwere subsequently inserted. While the precise portions of evidence were not\n\nmarked for the benefit of the Court, a careful reading of his evidence directs to\n\nPage 6 of 17\n\nsuch subsequent insertions to be the date of execution of the guarantee bond,\n\nthe reference number of the lease agreement, the personal details of the\n\nguarantors (entered below their respective signatures), and the name and\n\naddress of the lessee."

He takes up the position that, by\n\nleaving blank spaces in the guarantee bond to be filled later, the lender has\n\nmade a fundamental mistake which makes the agreement void.\n\n[13] However, it is noted that any subsequent insertion ipso facto would not render\n\na contract unenforceable, but rather enforceability would be determined by the\n\nnature of the alteration and the knowledge or consent of the executing party. A\n\ncontract can be vitiated where the insertion constitutes a material alteration\n\nthat fundamentally changes the obligations undertaken, or where the signature\n\nwas obtained by fraud or misrepresentation.\n\n[14] In the present case, it is not disputed that the Appellant executed the guarantee\n\nas surety of the 1st Defendant under the lease agreement.

As\n\nheld in Pigot\u2019s Case (1614)1 it was established that such post-execution\n\nchanges could render an instrument void, the rationale being that no party\n\nshould be held to obligations materially different from those they agreed to\n\nwhen affixing their signature and seal.

As\n\nPotter LJ observed, material alterations fall broadly into two categories:\n\nI. those which change the very nature or character of the instrument, and\n\nII. those which are potentially prejudicial to the legal rights or obligations of\n\nthe guarantor.\n\nAn alteration falling within either of these points will discharge a guarantor who\n\ndid not assent to it.\n\n[17] In the above case, the guarantor, argued that a guarantee had been invalidated\n\nbecause, after he had signed it, the bank inserted into clause 37 the name and\n\naddress of a company (Crossseas Shipping Ltd) as his agent for service of\n\nprocess in England. The Court accepted that the insertion was made without his\n\n1 (1614) 11 Co Rep 26b, 77 ER 1177. 2 [2000] 1 WLR 1135\n\nPage 8 of 17\n\nknowledge or consent but held that the alteration was not material because it\n\nwas procedural in nature and did not alter the fundamental obligations under\n\nthe guarantee.\n\n[18] As Cresswell J explained:"

The Respondent\u2019s witness clarified that the\n\npractice is to furnish guarantors with a translation of the guarantee bond which\n\ninstruments on the rubber stamp appears to be a standard form in which the\n\ninapplicable words were not struck out. Importantly, the Appellant has never\n\nasserted that he did not receive a translation of the guarantee bond itself.\n\nPage 13 of 17\n\n[29] As explained above, the law does not require that the lease agreement be\n\ntranslated for the guarantor, it is sufficient that he understands his\n\nresponsibilities under the bond. On the evidence, that requirement was met.\n\n1.3 Analysis\n\n[30] The 3rd Defendant-Appellant takes up the position that he is not liable to pay\n\nthe demanded sum since the guarantee bond was incomplete at the time he\n\nplaced his signature. The Appellant also contends that due to his inability to\n\nread and understand the English language, he required a Sinhala translation of\n\nthe Agreement, which was not given to him. Under cross-examination, the 3rd\n\nDefendant-Appellant refers to certain numbers in document P8, which he\n\nclaims include the typewritten parts.\n\n[31] The Respondent was obligated to explain to the guarantors the nature of the\n\ntransaction and the liability imposed on them in the event the principal debtor\n\ndefaults.

(Lessee). The period of lease was from 12.10.2005 to 12.10.2010.\n\nThe Lease Agreement stipulated 60 monthly rentals of Rs. 150,203 each and a 24% per\n\nannum interest on delayed payments.\n\nPage 4 of 18\n\nIn terms of Clause 7 of the Lease Agreement, the Lessee agreed that any default being\n\nmade by it in the payment of money due thereon or otherwise acting in breach of the\n\nterms and conditions thereof, it shall be lawful for the Plaintiff to terminate the Lease\n\nAgreement and to recover the money which are due thereon.\n\nThe offer letter (P1) required a guarantee from the 2nd Defendant and the 1st Defendant-\n\nRespondent (1st Defendant) as security. They were, at that time, shareholders and\n\ndirectors of the Lessee.\n\nAccordingly, a Guarantee of Lease Agreement (Guarantee) dated 02.09.2005, was\n\nexecuted by the 1st and 2nd Defendants.\n\nFollowing a payment default commencing around August 2006, the 1st Defendant\n\nsurrendered the vehicle on 17.10.2006, requesting its sale to reduce the debt. The Plaintiff\n\nformally terminated the Lease Agreement on 02.11.2006.

In\n\nsupport of this proposition, he cited the decisions in Bradford Old Bank v. Sutcliffe [(1918)\n\n2 KB 833], L.B. Finance v. Manchanayake [(2000) 2 Sri LR 142], Seylan Bank Ltd. v. Inter\n\nTrade Garments (Pvt) Ltd. [(2005) 1 Sri LR 80] and Sivasubramaniam v. Alagamuttu (53\n\nNLR 150)].\n\nThe heading of the Guarantee states \u201cGuarantee of Lease Agreement\u201d.

Dharmabandhu, Executive Officer. Along with\n\nhis affidavit, documents marked P1 to P6(d) was tendered in evidence. P6(b) was the\n\ndemand made on the 2nd Defendant. At the commencement of his examination-in-chief,\n\nCounsel for the 2nd Defendant moved that document marked P5 should be marked subject\n\nto proof. P5 was the Statement of Account. None of the other documents including P6(b)\n\nwere marked subject to proof.\n\nWhere no objection is taken when the document is sought to be tendered in evidence,\n\nand the document is not forbidden by law to be received in evidence, any objection to its\n\nreceipt as evidence is deemed to have been waived.

Even assuming that this\n\nwas a reference to documents marked P6(a), P6(b) and P6(c), it was an exercise in futility\n\nand an attempt to close the stable door after the horse has bolted.

On an objective reading of the arbitration\n\nclause as well as the Lease Agreement as a whole, the scope of the arbitration clause\n\ncovers only disputes between the Lessor and Lessee.\n\nNone of the parties to this action is a bank. The Lease Agreement is not part of a banking\n\ntransaction. Hence, the transaction between the parties in this action does not fall within\n\nBanks and Banking in Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance. The governing law of the Lease\n\nAgreement is Roman-Dutch law.\n\nPage 8 of 18\n\nThere was a general rule in early Roman law that a contract should not benefit or bind a\n\nthird party. This was known as alteri stipulari non potest. A stranger to a contract was\n\noutside the scope of the rights and duties arising thereunder. This rigid rule was subject\n\nto progressive modification in later Roman law.\n\nRoman-Dutch law did not adopt the strict approach of Roman law to third party rights.\n\nAccording to Grotius (3.3.38), Roman-Dutch law allows a third party to accept the promise\n\nand thus acquire a right unless the promisor revokes the promise before such acceptance\n\nby the third party. Similarly, a stipulation in a contract in favour of a third party can be\n\nenforced by such party where it has been accepted by him [Jinadasa v. Silva (34 NLR 344),\n\nDe Silva v. Margaret Nona (40 NLR 251), Marthelis Appuhamy v. Peiris (47 NLR 78].\n\nThe arbitration clause does not have any stipulation indicating that the 1st and 2nd\n\nDefendants as Guarantors are to benefit from it.\n\nMoreover, according to Roman-Dutch law, the obligation created thereunder is\n\nindependent of the obligations created under the Lease Agreement and the 2nd Defendant\n\ncannot rely on the scope of the arbitration clause contained in the Lease Agreement. Let\n\nme explain my conclusion.\n\nAccording to Weeramantry [The Law of Contracts, Vol. I, page 190], contracts which\n\ncharge a person with the debt, default or miscarriage of another are contracts of"

Let\n\nme explain my conclusion.\n\nAccording to Weeramantry [The Law of Contracts, Vol. I, page 190], contracts which\n\ncharge a person with the debt, default or miscarriage of another are contracts of\n\n\u201cguarantee\u201d are interchangeable.\n\nIndeed, many writings and judicial decisions do reflect this understanding [See Caney\u2019s\n\nThe Law of Suretyship, 1st and 2nd editions; Walter Pereira, The Laws of Ceylon, Vol. II, page\n\n629; Geraldine Andrews and Richard Millet, Law of Guarantees [6th ed.

In Walker\u2019s Fruit Farms Ltd v. Sumner [1930 TPD 394 at 398], Greenberg,\n\nJ. held that the ordinary meaning is to assure a person of the receipt or possession of\n\nsomething. In Dempster v.

The defendant\n\nhad signed a document in which he guaranteed specific performance of the contract for\n\nthere was no principal obligation and no suretyship. The Court held that the clause\n\nresulted in an independent undertaking. The defendant had contracted as a co-principal\n\ndebtor and not surety. His undertaking was held not to be dependent upon the non-\n\nperformance of the purchaser but was in the form of an indemnity. Here the use of the\n\nword guarantee was construed to create an independent obligation and hence the\n\nundertaking was not a suretyship. Such result is not possible if one were to assume that\n\n\u201csuretyship\u201d and \u201cguarantee\u201d are interchangeable.\n\nSimilarly, in List v. Jungers [1979(3) SA 106 (A) at 117-119] the use of the word guarantee\n\nwas held by Court to mean an original undertaking whereby the promisor bound himself\n\nas principal debtor and not as surety.\n\nPage 10 of 18\n\nThese authorities support the statement in Caney\u2019s The Law of Suretyship [Forsyth &\n\nPretorius (eds.), 5th edition (Juta & Co.

Caney [supra. page 31] goes on to state that with a contract\n\nof guarantee, the guarantor undertakes a principal obligation to indemnify the promisee\n\non the happening of certain events.\n\nAccording to Caney [supra., page 32]:\n\n\u201cWhat then is the difference between a guarantee that a debtor will perform and\n\nsuretyship? Lubbe makes one point of distinction clear : the guarantor\u2019s obligation,\n\nas an obligation independent of that of the debtor, is to indemnify the creditor in\n\nrespect of losses suffered through the debtor\u2019s non-performance, whereas the\n\nsurety, as we have seen, is only liable for losses resulting from the debtor\u2019s breach"

It was rejected by the learned trial judge by his\n\norder dated 10.07.2012. Court held that although the Lease Agreement contained an\n\narbitration clause, there is no such clause in the Guarantee.

Lack of competency may arise in one of two ways. A court may lack\n\njurisdiction over the cause or matter or over the parties; it may also lack\n\ncompetence because of failure to comply with such procedural requirements as are\n\nnecessary for the exercise of power by the court.

The\n\nletter marked V36 contains no denial of the liability acknowledged in\n\nP8, while the document marked V52 amounts to no more than a\n\nrequest by the Malaysian supplier that payment be made to the\n\nAppellant. That request, however, does not create any legal obligation\n\n\u200b\u200b13\n\nbinding upon the Respondent, nor does it reflect any agreement by the\n\nRespondent to alter the existing contractual relationship with the\n\nAppellant.\n\nThe Learned High Court Judge observed that the absence of a written\n\ntripartite agreement is of material significance.

    "chunk_text": "order to create a valid and enforceable agreement between two or more\n\nparties. As enumerated by C. G. Weeramantry in The Law of\n\nContracts, Volume I at page 84, the prerequisites of a contract are:\u200b\n\n(a) an agreement between the parties;\u200b\n\nobligation;\u200b\n\n(c) due observance of prescribed forms or modes of agreement;\u200b\n\n(d) legality and possibility of the object of the agreement; and\u200b\n\n(e) capacity of the parties to contract.\n\nAs noted in Chitty on Contracts Volume 1 General Principles (31st\n\ned., Sweet & Maxwell, para. 2-003), the essentials of a valid contract\n\ninclude agreement, consideration (or causa), intention to create legal\n\nrelations, capacity, and, where applicable, proper form. Nonetheless,\n\neven when these requisites are satisfied, the contract may nonetheless\n\nbe void or voidable if vitiated by misrepresentation, mistake, duress,\n\nundue influence, or illegality. The Roman-Dutch legal tradition which\n\nunderpins Sri Lankan contract law similarly insists that consent must\n\n\u200b\u200b14\n\nbe free from error, force or fraud (Voet Commentarius ad Pandectas\n\n2.14.7), and our courts have consistently held that absence of\n\ngenuine consent undermines enforceability.\n\nTherefore, based on the established principles governing the law of\n\nContract, it is well established that the mere presence of offer and\n\nacceptance does not, of itself, suffice to constitute a valid and\n\nenforceable contract. The law further requires additional elements\n\nsuch as consideration or causa, an intention to create legal relations,\n\ncompliance with any prescribed form, and the legal capacity of the\n\nparties. Yet, even the concurrence of all these essentials does not\n\ninvariably guarantee the validity of the agreement. Where the\n\ntransaction is tainted by vitiating factors such as duress, the\n\npurported contract cannot, in law, be regarded as binding.\n\nIn Wimala Perera v. Kalyani Siriyalatha [2011] 1 SLR 182,\n\nJustice Shiranee Tilakawardane affirmed that:\n\n\u201cIt is an elementary rule that every contract requires an offer"

Kalyani Siriyalatha [2011] 1 SLR 182,\n\nJustice Shiranee Tilakawardane affirmed that:\n\n\u201cIt is an elementary rule that every contract requires an offer\n\naccepted, is not actionable [vide Justice Weerasooriya in\n\nMuthukuda v. Sumanawathie 4 NLR 321 at 208, 209]. It has\n\nbeen stated that it is an elementary proposition of law that a\n\ncontract is concluded when in the mind of each contracting\n\nparty there is a consensus ad idem, Noorbhai v. Karuppan\n\nChetty (1925) 27 NLR 325 (per Lord Wrenbury). Cumulatively\n\ntherefore an intention to create a legal relationship and a\n\nconsensus ad idem or meeting of the minds needs to be in\n\nexistence in order to establish a contract between the parties.\u201d\n\nSoertsz J. in Edward Silva v. De Silva [1945] 46 NLR 510 also\n\nemphasised that, for a promise to be enforceable,\n\n\u200b\u200b15\n\n\u201cthe agreement must be a deliberate, serious act, not one that\n\nis irrational or motiveless.\u201d\n\nThese principles resonate with established common law doctrines. In\n\nBalfour v. Balfour [1919] 2 KB 571, Atkin LJ underscored that not\n\nall agreements are legally binding unless there is an intention to\n\ncreate legal relations, while in Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.\n\n[1893] 1 QB 256, the English Court of Appeal affirmed that where\n\nthere is a clear offer, acceptance, and consideration, coupled with an\n\nintention to be bound, the promise becomes enforceable. These\n\ncomparative authorities highlight that the bedrock of contractual\n\nliability lies in consensus ad idem, intention, and enforceability in law.\n\nIn the case of People\u2019s Bank v Ceylinco Insurance Company\n\nLimited [SC CHC Appeal 06/2003 decided on 11.02.2016] it was\n\nheld that,\n\n\u201cI am of the view that any Court is entitled to look into the\n\nsurrounding circumstances in order to identify the scope and\n\nobject of the guarantee bonds just as much as it would be\n\nentitled to look at the factual matrix as an aid to the"

The Respondent relies upon, inter alia, the admitted letter\n\ndated 6th September 2004 (marked P8), wherein the Appellant\n\nexpressly acknowledged the said liability and undertook to make\n\npayment.\n\n\u200b\u200b16\n\nThe Appellant stance is that the true arrangement was tripartite,\n\ninvolving the Malaysian supplier, Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD,\n\nwith the Respondent acting merely as an intermediary. The alleged\n\nmeeting of 4th September 2004 is unsupported by any\n\ncontemporaneous documentation, while P8, signed two days later by\n\nthe Appellant\u2019s own officer who attended that meeting, is a clear\n\nwritten acknowledgment of liability to the Respondent. Thus, even if\n\ndiscussions took place with a view to involving the Malaysian supplier,\n\nthey did not crystallise into a legally binding arrangement; instead, the\n\noperative agreement remained the one evidenced in P8.

I am in agreement with this conclusion.\n\nNo contemporaneous document has been produced by the Appellant\n\nto substantiate the existence of a tripartite arrangement, and it is\n\nsignificant that the Malaysian supplier, who would have been a\n\nnecessary party to such an arrangement, was not included in these\n\nproceedings. As the High Court Judge rightly observed, had such a\n\ntripartite agreement existed, it would inevitably have been reflected in\n\neither V36 or V52; however, neither document contains any reference\n\nto such an arrangement. P8 here is not the product of casual\n\n\u200b\u200b17\n\ndiscussion or informal understanding but a deliberate and\n\nunequivocal commitment.\n\nThe Appellant further alleged that the Respondent engaged in\n\nunder-invoicing with its Malaysian supplier. With regard to the\n\nallegation of under-invoicing, the High Court Judge rightly held that\n\nsuch matters are wholly irrelevant to the civil obligations between the\n\npresent parties. The contract in question is confined to the\n\nrelationship between the Appellant and the Respondent, and any\n\nallegation of under-invoicing between the Respondent and its\n\nMalaysian supplier does not impinge upon the enforceability of that\n\ncontract. I am inclined to affirm this view, which is consistent with the\n\nprinciple that collateral arrangements or irregularities with third\n\nparties do not vitiate an otherwise binding agreement. Even where\n\nsuch collateral conduct is suggested, it does not nullify a contract that\n\nis otherwise valid and enforceable.

Abdeen (57 NLR 1 at 3)]. I will\n\ntherefore briefly examine the availability of this remedy in Roman-Dutch law.\n\nIt is not clear whether specific performance was a remedy available in Roman law. Lee\n\nmakes contradictory statements in stating that decrees of specific performance were\n\nunknown [Lee R.W., The Elements of Roman Law, IV Edition, Sweet & Maxwell (1956),\n\n441] while later claiming that specific performance may be decreed [ibid. page 457].\n\nWeeramantry [The Law of Contracts, Vol. 2, (Lawman (India) Pvt., Reprint 1999) pgs. 952-\n\n953] explains that during the formulary period, Roman law did not compel specific\n\nperformance. It was sufficient for the payment of id quod interest. He opines that given\n\nthat the maxim of Roman law being nemo potest praecise cogi ad factum (no one can be\n\nPage 10 of 18\n\ncompelled to perform a specific act), it was unusual for the grant of the remedy of specific\n\nperformance.\n\nThere is a divergence of opinion among jurists of the availability of specific performance\n\nin Roman Dutch law.\n\nAccording, to Van Der Linden [1.14.7], where the obligation consists in performing a\n\nparticular act, the oblige may sue the obligor for the performance of that act, or\n\ncompensation in damages and interest.\n\nGrotius [3.3.41] states that although by natural law a person who has promised to do\n\nsomething is bound to do it if it is in his power, he may nevertheless by municipal law\n\nrelease himself by paying the other contracting party the value of his interest in the same\n\nor the penalty, if any, which has been agreed upon in default of payment."

Berry [(1912) AD 343 at 350] where Innes, J. held:\n\n\u201cPrima facie every party to a binding agreement who is ready to carry out his own\n\nobligation under it has a right to demand from the other party, so far as it is\n\nPage 11 of 18\n\npossible, a performance of his undertaking in terms of the contract. As remarked\n\nby KOTZE C.J., in Thompson vs. Pullinger (1 O. R., at p. 301), \u201cthe right of a plaintiff\n\nto the specific performance of a contract where the defendant is in a position to do\n\nso is beyond doub\u201d. It is true that Courts will exercise a discretion in determining\n\nwhether or not decrees of specific performance should be made. They will not, of\n\ncourse, be issued where it is impossible for the defendant to comply with them. And\n\nthere are many cases in which justice between the parties can be fully and\n\nconveniently done by an award of damages. But that is a different thing from\n\nsaying that a defendant who has broken his undertaking has the option to purge"

The plaintiffs alleged that on February 6, 1940, they tendered to the\n\ndefendant the sum of Rs. 6,325 in cash which the defendant did not receive. They\n\ninstituted action on February 7, 1940, for specific performance of the agreement to\n\nreconvey, but did not bring the money into Court until January 23, 1941, the day before\n\nthe date fixed for the hearing of the action. The Privy Council held, that the failure of the\n\nplaintiffs to bring the money into Court with the plaint was a very serious omission.\n\nThe reasoning of the Privy Council does not show per se an examination of the relevant\n\nprinciples of Roman-Dutch law. Nevertheless, it is a fundamental legal principle in Roman-\n\nDutch law that the party seeking to enforce a contract must be ready and willing to\n\nperform his part of the bargain. This necessarily leads to the conclusion that a party\n\nseeking to obtain specific performance of a contractual stipulation which is conditional\n\nPage 14 of 18\n\nupon the payment of a sum of money, must bring the amount due to Court and deposit\n\nit to the credit of the action at the time of filing the plaint."

The Plaintiff\n\nstates that if the reliefs sought by the Defendant were granted, it would leave the Plaintiff\u2019s\n\nbenefit.\n\nThe Plaintiff, placing reliance on the dicta in Mercin v Edwin [1984] 1 Sri L.R. 224, submits\n\nthat when a person establishes physical user of a right-of-way for the prescriptive method, he\n\nis entitled to succeed in a claim of prescriptive user and mere enjoyment of the right is proof\n\nPage 7 of 10\n\nof the adverse user. The Plaintiff contends that the Defendant has not successfully challenged\n\nor disputed the Plaintiff\u2019s use of the roadway since purchasing the land in 1970. The Plaintiff\n\nclaims rights not through a formal title but through prescription, asserting adverse use of the\n\nroadway against all others, including the Defendant, for over a decade before the District\n\nCourt case began. Additionally, the Plaintiff points to Surveyor\u2019s Plan No. 3159 (\u2018P1\u2019), which\n\nindicates that the disputed roadway is the only connection between \u2018Weerasinghe Mawatha\u2019\n\nand the Plaintiff\u2019s land, with the surveyor\u2019s testimony confirming the Plaintiff\u2019s undisturbed\n\nand continuous use of the roadway since taking possession of the land described in the 1st\n\nSchedule of the Plaint.\n\nA cogent argument of the Defendant is that the Plaintiff\u2019s title deed from 1970 (\u2018P8\u2019) and the\n\nDeed of Gift (\u2018P9\u2019) to his children in 1985 make no mention of any right-of-way.\n\nConsequently, the Defendant asserts that no right-of-way was conveyed through these deeds,\n\nand the Plaintiff failed to prove as to when the road usage began. Another aspect of the\n\nsubmissions made on behalf of the Defendant is that the Plaintiff\u2019s alleged \u201cunchallenged and\n\nuncontradicted\u201d 20-year residence in Australia undermines any claim to prescriptive rights\n\nover the disputed strip of land through usage.

The Defendant, placing reliance on Fernando v\n\nSumanatissa Thero 36 NLR 422 and Silva et al. v Kumarihamy 25 NLR 449 submits that the\n\nHigh Court as well as the District Court have erred in law by concluding that the Plaintiff has\n\nprescribed to the subject roadway shown in the said Plan No.255 (\u2018P3\u2019), which shows that the\n\nroadway was made in 1999 after the District Court action was instituted.

Thus, it is the Defendant\u2019s contention that even if there were occasional or incidental\n\nthe Plaintiff a legal right-of-way.\n\nTo claim prescriptive title, a plaintiff must meet three key legal conditions: first, their\n\npossession of the property must be continuous and undisturbed; second, this possession must\n\nbe independent of or adverse to the Defendant\u2019s title; and third, it must have lasted for at least\n\nten years immediately before the lawsuit. The principle of \"adverse user\" is fundamental to\n\nclaiming a prescriptive title. The law, however, provides a clear framework for establishing\n\nthis hostility through a well-defined shift in the burden of proof. At the trial, licensed surveyor\n\nKarunaratne Costa testified, confirming the existence of the roadway and its role as the only\n\naccess to the Plaintiff\u2019s land. Documentary evidence included Plan No. 3159 (\u2018P1\u2019), Plan No.\n\n255 (\u2018P3\u2019), and the Police Complaint (\u2018P7\u2019). The Plaintiff also presented a building plan (\u2018P10\u2019)\n\nand a sketch (\u2018P11\u2019), both of which identified the roadway as the access to the Plaintiff\u2019s block\n\nof land. Additionally, utility bills and assessment notices (\u2018P14\u2019 to \u2018P37\u2019) were submitted,\n\nshowing the property was consistently identified and assessed based on its access from\n\n\u2018Weerasinghe Mawatha\u2019. Substantial evidence presented to the District Court demonstrates\n\nthat the Plaintiff has been using the roadway from the outset, starting five years before the\n\nDefendant acquired his land.\n\nThus, upon an overall consideration of the evidence, I agree with the Trial Judge's conclusion\n\nthat the Plaintiff had uninterrupted use of the roadway since 1970, thereby establishing\n\ncontinuous possession.

This use, which began before the Defendant acquired the adjacent\n\nDefendant\u2019s rights.

The Defendant\u2019s failure to discharge this burden, compounded by the\n\nfact that the Plaintiff's use began before the Defendant owned the land, makes his arguments\n\nuntenable.\n\nThe Defendant\u2019s challenge to the continuity of possession, citing the Plaintiff\u2019s absence, is not\n\nstrong enough without proof that the possession of the roadway actually ceased.\n\nWigneswaran, J in Leisa and another v Simon and Another [2002] 1 Sri.

Based on the evidence\n\nadduced at the Trial, it cannot be assumed that the Plaintiff\u2019s possession was ousted due to\n\nhis alleged visit to Australia. No evidence was led to confirm that the Plaintiff\u2019s absence was\n\nnot temporary or that he could not return and re-enter the property at any moment, upon his\n\nchoice, without anybody\u2019s permission. Thus, the Defendant\u2019s argument that the prescription\n\nclaim would be untenable due to the Plaintiff leaving for Australia will fail as it lacks sufficient\n\nsupporting evidence on the above aspects.\n\nThe Plaintiff also sought a right-of-way of necessity as an alternative relief, which the District\n\nCourt granted and the High Court upheld.

This type of conduct on the part of the\n\nplaintiff must not be encouraged, for it amounts to an abuse of the Partition\n\nLaw.\n\n3\n\nSC/APPEAL/174/2015\n\nThere are several sections in the Partition Law that compel the plaintiff to\n\nbring all the parties who have some claim to the land. For instance, section\n\n5 of the Partition Law enacts that the plaintiff in a partition action shall\n\ninclude in his plaint as parties to the action all persons who, whether in\n\nactual possession or not, to his knowledge are entitled or claim to be entitled\n\nto any right, share or interest to, of, or in the land to which the action\n\nrelates, whether vested or contingent, and whether by way of mortgage,\n\nlease, usufruct, servitude, trust, life interest, or otherwise, or to any\n\nimprovements made or effected on or to the land. It is significant to note\n\nthat the duty of the plaintiff is not limited to including those who are in fact\n\nentitled to rights, but extends also to those who claim to be entitled or who\n\nhave effected improvements. The plaintiff in the present case manifestly\n\ndisregarded this statutory obligation.\n\nSince the second survey in 1997, 28 years have lapsed.

This kind of voluntary alienations are contrary to section 66 of\n\nthe Partition Law, and in my view the 59th defendant ought not to have been\n\nadded as a party. The 59th defendant filed no statement of claim.\n\nBy Journal Entry No. 111 dated 25.05.1995, the 59th defendant was\n\nsubstituted as plaintiff on the basis that the original plaintiff had sold his\n\nrights in the land to him.

The \ufb01rst was to order the reinstatement of the Applicant. Prior to exercising this op\u019fon, there are two ma\u01a9ers that must be considered. The \ufb01rst is whether reinstatement is expedient or appropriate in the circumstances of the case. If the answer is in the a\ufb03rma\u019fve, the second considera\u019fon is whether the Applicant should be reinstated with back wages, and if so, whether the Applicant was en\u019ftled to back wages from the date her services were terminated un\u019fl reinstatement or for a lesser period. If the Tribunal was of the view that reinstatement was not expedient or warranted, the second op\u019fon available to it was to award compensa\u019fon as an alterna\u019fve to reinstatement. In-built in this op\u019fon was to decide on the applicable criteria in determining the quantum of compensa\u019fon. Whether it be back wages or compensa\u019fon, the prime considera\u019fon is to redress the Applicant for the \ufb01nancial loss caused as a result of the unfair dismissal. 36) The decision whether the reinstatement of an employee is expedient or appropriate\n\nwould depend on the facts and circumstances peculiar to that case and may include the following:\n\n(i) The nature of the services performed by the employee;\n\n14\n\n(ii) The nature of the charges levelled against the employee; (iii) Whether any of the charges established at the domes\u019fc inquiry include\n\nmisappropria\u019fon of funds by the employee or fraud on the part of the employee; (iv) Whether the acts of misconduct alleged involve moral turpitude and/or gross"

Thus, the Labour Tribunal acted irra\u019fonally and clearly erred when it took into considera\u019fon an irrelevant fact. 42) The next ques\u019fon is, if not for the above error, did the facts of this case warrant an\n\norder for reinstatement. The answer to this ques\u019fon is twofold. The \ufb01rst is, present before the Tribunal was an employee who had ten years of unblemished service, but who stood unfairly accused of misinterpre\u019fng circulars and paying employees a salary over and above their en\u019ftlement whereas the payment thereof had been authorised by the Board of Directors of the Respondent and the Applicant had no role to play in that decision. This was aggravated by the fact that the Inquiry O\ufb03cer chose to ignore the said approval evidenced by the document E50 even though his a\u01a9en\u019fon was drawn to it. The second factor is that the Respondent did not lead any evidence to establish that the reinstatement of the Applicant would not be expedient or appropriate in the circumstances of this case. 43) With the age of the Applicant not being a bar to the Applicant being reinstated, and\n\nwith the Labour Tribunal not being concerned with any other ground that would make reinstatement inexpedient, there was no impediment to an order being made for the reinstatement of the Applicant. Thus, in my view, the Labour Tribunal erred\n\n17\n\nwhen it refused to order the reinstatement of the Applicant on the basis of the age of re\u019frement of the Applicant.

Thus, the High Court failed to appreciate that (a) as long as the Applicant was within the age of re\u019frement at the \u019fme of the Order, there was no legal impediment to the reinstatement of the Applicant, and (b) such remedy was the most just and equitable order that the Labour Tribunal could have made in the circumstances of this case. 49) The third ground is when it stated that the Applicant had sought compensa\u019fon in\n\nlieu of reinstatement, thus demonstra\u019fng that she is content with an order for compensa\u019fon as opposed to reinstatement.

But Parliament cannot, by a constitutional\n\namendment, give itself a blanket authorisation to affect an entrenched\n\njurisdiction by means of a subsequent ordinary law. For example,\n\nParliament cannot confer an entrenched jurisdiction of this Court (e.g.\n\nunder Articles 125 to 127) on High Courts, by an Act passed under and\n\nin terms of Article 154P(3). However, the jurisdiction of the Court of\n\nAppeal under Article 138 is not an entrenched jurisdiction, because\n\nArticle 138 provides that it is subject to the provisions \u201cof any law\u201d;\n\nhence it was always constitutionally permissible for that jurisdiction to\n\nbe reduced or transferred by ordinary law (of course, to a body entitled\n\nto exercise judicial power).

By way of illustration, section 74(2) of the Primary Courts\u2019\n\nProcedure Act No. 44 of 1979, expressly provides that no appeal lies against\n\nan order made under section 66 of that Act. In such circumstances, an\n\naggrieved party may invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial\n\nHigh Court to challenge such orders.\n\nSince section 9 of Act No. 19 of 1990 states that appeals to the Supreme\n\nCourt lies against judgments and orders made by the Provincial High Court\n\n\u201cin the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction\u201d, in cases such as Gunaratne v.\n\nThambinayagam [1993] 2 Sri LR 355, Abeygunasekera v.

In the impugned\n\norder, the Court of Appeal, following Gunawardane v. Muthukumarana\n\njurisdiction on the basis that it is distinct from its appellate jurisdiction. I\n\nam unable to agree with that view.\n\nConsider, for instance, a situation in which a Provincial High Court, in the\n\nexercise of its appellate jurisdiction, enters judgment for the plaintiff. Two\n\ndefendants, independently contesting the case, thereafter pursue divergent\n\nappellate remedies: one appeals to the Supreme Court with leave obtained,\n\nwhilst the other files a revision application before the Court of Appeal. If the\n\nSupreme Court were to affirm the judgment of the Provincial High Court\n\nwhile the Court of Appeal were simultaneously to set it aside, the result\n\nwould be an untenable jurisdictional conflict. Such a situation would not\n\nonly create inconsistency and uncertainty in the administration of justice,\n\nbut would also erode the hierarchical finality envisaged by the Constitution,\n\nwhich recognises the Supreme Court as the apex judicial body.\n\nRecognition of such a practice would also encourage \u201cjudge shopping\u201d or\n\n\u201cforum shopping\u201d to secure a favourable forum, which a Five Judge Bench\n\nof this Court in JMC Jayasekara Management Centre (Pvt) Limited v.\n\nCommissioner General of Inland Revenue [2024/25] BLR 557 at 566\n\nemphatically declared \u201cmust be stopped at any cost\u201d.\n\n29\n\nSC/APPEAL/65/2025\n\nAt the hearing before this court, it was submitted that the reason for filing\n\nthe application in revision and restitutio in integrum before the Court of\n\nAppeal was the plaintiff\u2019s desire to secure an early resolution of the matter,\n\ngiven the heavy workload of this court.

Both must therefore be construed in a consistent manner.\n\nIn Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd v. Perera [2012] BLR 14, the defendant\n\nfiled a revision application before the Court of Appeal against an order made\n\nby the Provincial High Court in the Western Province established by the\n\nHigh Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996. The\n\nSupreme Court held that, following the enactment of that Act, a person\n\ndissatisfied with any judgment or order of a Provincial High Court\n\nestablished thereunder may appeal only to the Supreme Court in terms of\n\nsection 5, and that the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to entertain an\n\nappeal or revision application against a judgment or order pronounced by\n\nsuch a Provincial High Court. Suresh Chandra J., with the concurrence of\n\nMarsoof J. and Ekanayake J., observed at page 18:\n\nThe sequence of the enactment of the Acts makes it evident that in\n\nrelation to a matter in the District Court the Right to Appeal from a\n\njudgment would be to the Court of Appeal and then if leave is granted\n\nan appeal would lie to the Supreme Court. By the enactment of Act\n\nNo.10 of 1996 it is clear that in any civil matter dealt with in the High\n\nCourt, the Right of Appeal lies only to the Supreme Court. This seems\n\nto be the clear intention of the Legislature with regard to matters dealt\n\nin the High Court. When the above special provisions are being\n\nconsidered in the High Court, if revisionary jurisdiction to the Court of\n\nAppeal is given then it would give the party applying for revision in a\n\n40\n\nSC/APPEAL/65/2025"

If the\n\nProvincial High Courts were entirely devoid of restitutio in integrum\n\njurisdiction, the statutory authority to transfer such applications would be\n\nrendered meaningless, and the receiving court would lack competence to\n\ndetermine the matter.

In that case,\n\nat page 310, this court held as follows:\n\nSection 9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No.\n\n19 of 1990, as amended, does not oust the revisionary jurisdiction of\n\nthe Court of Appeal in respect of decisions made by a Provincial High\n\nCourt exercising its appellate powers.

Such conduct falls squarely within the prohibition under Article 11.

Article 13 (1) of the Constitution reads as follows:\n\n\u201cNo person shall be arrested except according to procedure established by law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest.\u201d\n\nPage 8 of 10\n\nIn Dissanayaka v Superintendent Mahara Prison and others, Kulatunga, J. stated the following to highlight the importance of examining the material to decide the validity of the arrest.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, it is for the Court to determine the validity of the arrest objectively. The Court will not surrender its judgement to the executive for if it did so, the fundamental right to freedom from arbitrary arrest secured by Article 13(1) of the Constitution will be defeated. The executive must place sufficient material before the Court to enable the Court to make a decision, such as the notes of investigation, including the statements of witnesses, observations etc. without relying on bare statements in affidavits\".

Attorney General and Others the Court held that,\n\n\u201cHowever the officer making an arrest cannot act on a suspicion founded on mere conjecture or vague surmise. His information must give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the suspect was concerned in the commission of an offence for which he could have arrested a person without a warrant.

I am of the opinion that the sequence of events, including the failure to produce the Petitioner before the JMO immediately after arrest, the contradictory medical reports and the corroborative affidavits of eyewitnesses, casts significant doubt on the veracity of the version set out in the Police B Report. While the report suggests that the Petitioner was lawfully apprehended with heroin in his possession, the surrounding circumstances strongly suggest that there is good reason to doubt the validity of the report. Further, the second JMO report also claims that there was no history of drug abuse, therefore the fact that the Petitioner had in his possession what is perceived to be is highly unlikely, thereby further invalidating the nature of the\n\nPage 9 of 10"

I am of the opinion that the sequence of events, including the failure to produce the Petitioner before the JMO immediately after arrest, the contradictory medical reports and the corroborative affidavits of eyewitnesses, casts significant doubt on the veracity of the version set out in the Police B Report. While the report suggests that the Petitioner was lawfully apprehended with heroin in his possession, the surrounding circumstances strongly suggest that there is good reason to doubt the validity of the report. Further, the second JMO report also claims that there was no history of drug abuse, therefore the fact that the Petitioner had in his possession what is perceived to be is highly unlikely, thereby further invalidating the nature of the\n\nPage 9 of 10\n\nJUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT\n\nPage 10 of 10\n\nYasantha Kodagoda, PC, J\n\nI agree.\n\nJUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT\n\nJanak De Silva, J I agree.\n\nJUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT"

The Respondent, by observations tendered on or\n\nabout 30/05/2008, admitted having been retained by the Complainant\n\nand acknowledged the receipt of professional fees.

The Supreme Court, in\n\nexercising its disciplinary jurisdiction under Section 42(2) of the\n\nJudicature Act No. 2 of 1978, must therefore act not only to censure the\n\nindividual but also to safeguard the collective integrity of the Bar.\n\n28. The Respondent\u2019s conduct, as found by the Disciplinary Committee,\n\nconstitutes a breach not only of specific rules, but of the very ethos of the\n\nprofession. The failure to act with diligence and honesty, particularly in\n\nfiduciary matters, is not a mere lapse, it is a betrayal of the professional\n\noath.\n\n1 A. R. B.

Such conduct is \u201cinexcusable and deplorable\u201d4 and\n\nmust be met with the full force of disciplinary sanction.\n\n30. In SC Rule No. 05/20225, this Court observed that the Respondent\u2019s\n\nfailure to file proper pleadings and maintain accurate records of client\n\nfunds deemed \u201cgross ineptitude and negligence\u201d, underscoring the\n\nimperative that Attorneys must act with scrupulous care and due\n\ndiligence.\n\n31.

This is not an academic judgment, but a matter of compliance with lawful administrative procedure.\n\nThe Respondents contend that under UGC Circular 721 and Establishment Circular 17/2005, the Petitioner was not eligible for appointment as Senior Lecturer Grade II or as an Associate Professor, as he had not obtained a First or Second Class in his basic degree, failed to produce his BSc certificate at the time of application, and had not completed a PhD until 2017, thereby qualifying only for Lecturer (Probationary). They argue further that his acceptance of the probationary appointment without protest, reliance on a disputed document (P-08), delay of fifteen years in filing the petition, suppression of material facts, and non-joinder of necessary parties render the application misconceived and time-barred."

    "chunk_text": "The Respondents contend that under UGC Circular 721 and Establishment Circular 17/2005, the Petitioner was not eligible for appointment as Senior Lecturer Grade II or as an Associate Professor, as he had not obtained a First or Second Class in his basic degree, failed to produce his BSc certificate at the time of application, and had not completed a PhD until 2017, thereby qualifying only for Lecturer (Probationary). They argue further that his acceptance of the probationary appointment without protest, reliance on a disputed document (P-08), delay of fifteen years in filing the petition, suppression of material facts, and non-joinder of necessary parties render the application misconceived and time-barred.\n\nWhile the Respondents stress technical ineligibility and procedural bars, the Petitioner emphasizes the arbitrariness, contradictory positions of the UGC.\n\nArticle 12(1) of the Constitution guarantees that \"All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law.\"\n\nPage 7 of 11\n\nThe phrase \"equality before the law\" appears in nearly all written constitutions and is derived from English law. In contrast, the term \"equal protection of the law\" first appeared in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Both expressions are employed in the Constitution of Sri Lanka, as they are in the Indian Constitution.\n\nArticle 14 of the Indian Constitution provides: \"The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.\" It is important to observe that, in the Indian context, this prohibition against inequality applies solely to the State. However, no such limitation exists under the Sri Lankan Constitution."

However, no such limitation exists under the Sri Lankan Constitution.\n\nThe notion of equality before the law is regarded as a negative concept, denoting the absence of special privileges for any individual and the equal subjection of all persons to the ordinary law. On the other hand, equal protection of the law is considered a more affirmative concept, connoting the equal application of the law in similar circumstances.\n\nJennings viewed equal treatment as encompassed within the idea of equality before the law, stating: \"Equality before the law means that among equals, the law should be equal and should be equally administered, that like should be treated alike.\" The underlying aim of both expressions is clearly the attainment of equal justice.\n\nDicey, asserting equality before the law to be a corollary of the famous doctrine of the rule of law, emphasised that it means,\n\n\u2018the supremacy or predominance of law as distinguished from mere arbitrariness (...

The petitioner in Sisira Senanayake v Land Reform Commission SC FR 190/2016 was selected for the post of Director, Finance in the Land Reform Commission after being interviewed.

Sinha, J. at page 53 held that:\n\n\u201cAn uncontrolled and arbitrary power without any restriction whatsoever cannot be granted to the executive or a non-legislative body, if it is possible by the exercise of such power to affect the rights guaranteed to a citizen to carry on trade or business.\u201d\n\nThe same principle applies here; the respondents\u2019 refusal to act on binding recommendations and legal directives, without any justification, amounts to an arbitrary exercise of discretion, infringing the petitioner\u2019s freedom to engage in his profession as protected by Article 14(1)(g).\n\nPage 10 of 11\n\nAlthough promotion is not a fundamental right, the petitioner was not merely seeking a discretionary promotion, rather, he was appointed under a representation that he would be regularized into a higher post, the very post that was advertised.
