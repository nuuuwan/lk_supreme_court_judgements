At the time of the\n\n5\n\narrest, however, the 1st accused who was charged with the commission\n\nof the aforementioned offences was the owner of the vehicle.\n\n2. On 12.12.2016, nine suspects excavating in the Elandamunei\n\nConservation forest were arrested along with tools used for excavation\n\nand a Van bearing Number SGPH 4430 (hereinafter referred to as the\n\nVehicle). At the time of the seizure, the registered owner of the vehicle\n\nwas the 1st accused and the absolute owner was the claimant\n\nrespondent. On 11.01.2017, the nine accused were charged for the\n\nfollowing offences in the Magistrate\u2019s Court of Kuchchaveli.\n\n\u2756 Commission of the offence of trespass in conservation forest under S.06\n\n(2)(a) of the Forest Ordinance.\n\n\u2756 Digging soil in a conservation forest which is an offence under S.06\n\n(2)(p) of the Forest Ordinance.\n\n\u2756 Excavation in a forest conservation for the purpose of discovery of\n\nantiquities - Section 15 (1) of the Antiquities Ordinance.\n\n3. Thereafter, on 11.01.2017, all nine accused persons including the\n\nregistered owner of the Vehicle, pleaded guilty to all the above\n\nmentioned charges and were sentenced. By motion dated 18.01.2017,\n\nthe absolute owner (claimant) made a claim for the vehicle. After inquiry\n\nthe learned Magistrate refused the claim and ordered to confiscate the\n\nvehicle.\n\n4.

According to the Counsel, the B-report doesn't provide\n\nanything clearly to demonstrate whether the vehicle was used to\n\ncommit the offence and therefore contends that Magistrate's order to\n\nconfiscate the vehicle is bad in law.\n\n12.

It is evident from the aforementioned section that, in order for a tool,\n\nmotor vehicle, cart, or similar item to be subject to confiscation upon\n\nconviction for an offence, it must have been used in the commission of\n\nthat particular offence. In the present case, the accused persons were\n\ncharged under Section 6(2)(a) of the Forest Ordinance for unlawfully\n\ntrespassing into a conservation forest.\n\n14.

In this connection I would like to consider a\n\npassage from 'Interpretation of Statutes by Bindra' 7' edition page 235.\n\n\"It is a well-known rule of construction that a statute should not be\n\nconstrued so as to impute absurdity to the legislature.\"\n\n17.

At the time of the inquiry, the Counsel for the respondent merely\n\nsubmitted that he was unaware of the accused intentions regarding the\n\nuse of the vehicle. He stated that he had no knowledge of any criminal\n\nacts that were to be committed using the said vehicle, and accordingly\n\n11\n\nsought the release of the vehicle on the basis of this lack of knowledge.\n\nHowever, no challenge was raised at that stage regarding the\n\njurisdiction of the Magistrates\u2019 Court.

A valuation report\n\ndated the same date, i.e. 16.12.1998 was provided to the Appellant which indicated the\n\ncurrent value of the van as Rs. 8,25,000/=.\n\nOn 22.12.1998, the Appellant issued a confirmed purchase order to the Respondent for a\n\nToyota HiAce van for the purchase price of Rs. 7,75,000/=. This was to be delivered to the\n\n2nd Respondent. It required the Respondent to return the second copy duly signed in\n\nconfirmation of its acceptance which was done by the Respondent.\n\nIt contained several terms and conditions which included that title to the property to be\n\nvested in the Appellant free from any liens and encumbrances and a leasing agreement\n\nto be properly entered into between the 2nd Respondent and Appellant.\n\nOn the same day, i.e. 22.12.1998 the 2nd Respondent issued a Sales Certificate to the\n\nRespondent acknowledging the receipt of the said van.\n\nPage 4 of 7\n\nThe Registrar of Motor Vehicles issued a document dated 29.12.1998 confirming that the\n\n2nd Respondent is the registered owner of the vehicle and that the Appellant is registered\n\nas the absolute owner.\n\nNevertheless, the Appellant failed to pay the Respondent the purchase price. The defense\n\nof the Appellant is that the valuation report does not describe the vehicle fully and as\n\nsuch the Respondent was informed by letter dated 23.12.1998 that the Appellant will not\n\nhold themselves responsible for any action taken by the Respondent to register the\n\nvehicle in either their name or in the name of the 2nd Respondent.\n\nTime of Repudiation"

The seal of the Post\n\nOffice on it showed 31.12.1998.\n\nHence the learned trial judge correctly concluded that the letter dated 23.12.1998 was\n\nsent after the van had been received by the 2nd Respondent and after its registration in\n\nthe name of the 2nd Respondent. According to the evidence of the Respondent, he\n\nreceived it on 04.01.1999.\n\nAccordingly, the learned trial judge entered judgment in favour of the Respondent for a\n\nsum of Rs. 7,75,000/= and legal interest from 22.12.1998 to 21.02.2007, the date of the\n\njudgment.\n\nUndisclosed Principal\n\nThe principal ground urged by the Appellant in this appeal is that the Respondent was\n\nacting as agent for an undisclosed principal and as such is not entitled to sue.\n\nPage 5 of 7\n\nThe Appellant correctly submitted that the Respondent came to Court as the owner of\n\nthe vehicle. This is reflected in paragraph 3 of the plaint. The Appellant contends that the\n\nRespondent sought to present a materially different case during his cross-examination by\n\nleading evidence of an undisclosed principal, Kuwick International, as the registered\n\nowner of the vehicle. It was submitted that this is contrary to explanation 2 to Section\n\n150 of the Civil Procedure Code which reads as follows:\n\n\u201cThe case enunciated must reasonably accord with the party's pleading, i.e., plaint\n\nor answer, as the case may be. And no party can be allowed to make at the trial a\n\ncase materially different from that which he has placed on record, and which his\n\nopponent is prepared to meet. And the facts proposed to be established must in the\n\nwhole amount to so much of the material part of his case as is not admitted in his\n\nopponent's pleadings.\u201d"

Accordingly, the\n\nAppellant submitted that it is not bound to pay the Respondent.\n\nI observe that it is the learned counsel for the Appellant who, during his cross-\n\nexamination, challenged the Respondent to produce any documentation establishing that\n\nKuwick International had handed over the possession of the vehicle to the Respondent. It\n\nis at that point of time, that document P10 was tendered in evidence. It is an invoice dated\n\n25.11.1998 issued by Kuwick International to the Respondent as the Manger of K.C.\n\nEnterprises. This invoice identifies K.C. Enterprises as the prospective purchaser of the\n\nvehicle. The evidence of the Respondent is that he got the vehicle from Kuwick\n\nInternational on credit basis on an oral agreement with a view to reselling the vehicle.\n\nI fail to see the relevance of any of these grounds for the Appellant to resist the claim of\n\nthe Respondent. It was not the position of the Appellant that the Respondent had induced\n\nthe Appellant to enter into an agreement by misrepresentation. On the contrary, the only\n\nPage 6 of 7\n\nground on which the Appellant sought to repudiate the contract was that the vehicle\n\nwhich the 2nd Respondent wanted from the Respondent was a Toyota Hiace van but the\n\nvehicle which was provided by the Respondent was a totally different vehicle.\n\nMoreover, the rights and liabilities of the Appellant, Respondent and Kuwick International\n\non the question of agency, is governed by English law. Where the principal is undisclosed\n\nat the time of contracting, the contract is made with the agent, and he is personally liable\n\nand entitled on it [Bowstead & Reynolds on Agency, 17th Ed., Sweet &Maxwell (2001),"

He further submitted that his client is of 55 years, and that since 25th September 2024 to date, he has been held in remand custody. Learned President\u2019s Counsel submitted that the Accused was a person with an unblemished character; he is married and has three children, including one child who is studying in the United Kingdom. He submitted that the Accused had to sell the family vehicle for the purpose of financing that child\u2019s overseas education. He is married to a teacher of a leading school in Colombo. She suffers from a heart condition and both she, as well as one child, suffers from a serious allergic condition. In these circumstances, learned President\u2019s Counsel submitted that he is seeking the mercy of this Court. 20.

Furthermore, it appears from the script of \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d that Shakespeare contrasts the authority of earthly rulers with the higher virtue of mercy. Moreover, he advances this view by linking mercy to the divine by describing mercy as an attribute of God himself. This in my view elevates mercy above human law and conduct. He frames mercy as a reflection of divine grace, with which I find myself in agreement. 56. In the real world, it is seen that mercy is exercised by (i) all-powerful monarchs, (ii)\n\nmonarchs who do not possess executive power and therefore are called upon by law or convention to act on the recommendations of the Head of the government (in the grant of clemency), and by (iii) human-beings acting in their personal capacities in\n\nSC/ CONTEMPT/ 03/ 2025 - JUDGMENT 28"

The reduction of these five marks did not prejudice the Petitioner or any other candidate as none of them possessed a PhD. In fact, it accrued to the advantage of the Petitioner as these five marks were added to the seniority category, for which the Petitioner was entitled to full marks, irrespective of whether she was marked under P7 or P13. 16) The second matter that I wish to advert to is Note III to P11, which reads as follows:"

They had requested that due recognition be given to the seniority of the employees who are eligible to apply, as they have been stagnating in the same grade for several years. Those who have signed 3R1 have also pointed out that there is a lack of uniformity in allotting marks between the various divisions within the 1st Respondent, and that persons such as the Petitioner who are attached to the Finance Division of the 1st Respondent have lost out from being promoted on many occasions as a result of due recognition not being afforded to seniority. 23) The learned Senior State Counsel submitted further that the said representations in"

It requires the case enunciated at the trial to be reasonably\n\nin accord with the party's pleading, i.e., plaint or answer, as the case may be. No party is\n\nallowed to make at the trial a case materially different from that which he has placed on\n\nrecord, and which his opponent is prepared to meet. The facts proposed to be established\n\nmust in the whole amount to so much of the material part of his case as is not admitted\n\nin his opponent's pleadings.\n\nA civil trial proceeds on the issues raised.

Allowing for differences in the system of pleading,\n\nthis answer will apply equally to the Roman Law, the Dutch Law, and the law\n\nof this Colony. In regard to the Roman system of civil process it is well known\n\nthat the mode of procedure underwent great changes from the early times of\n\nRome to the time of Justinian. Throughout these changes, however, it was\n\nalways considered necessary that the time when a contested right was to be\n\nconsidered as really made the subject of litigation should be carefully marked.\n\nIn the time of Justinian an action was begun with the denunciatio actionis, by\n\nwhich the plaintiff announced to a magistrate that he wished to bring an\n\naction. and furnished a short statement of his case. This statement might be\n\noral or in writing, and was sent by the Magistrate, through a bailiff of the\n\nCourt, to the defendant. The parties or their procurators appeared before the\n\nMagistrate, and he then and there decided the case. (...) The litis contestatio\n\ntook place directly the Magistrate began to hear the cause.\n\nIn Holland the mode of procedure was far more cumbrous, and the difficulty of\n\nmarking the exact time when the litis contestatio took place was\n\nproportionately greater than under the Roman system. In summary causes\n\n(such as actions for a decree of civil imprisonment, or for a decree of perpetual\n\nsilence) there was not much difficulty, for as soon as the defendant had\n\nobjected to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the litis contestatio was held to have taken\n\neffect (....), for the Court might then hear and decide the case without further\n\npleadings.\n\nAgain, a kind of fictitious litis contestatio was, according to Voet, admitted"

This\n\nwas a fact which the District Judge was completely ignorant of when delivered\n\nthe order depriving the substituted Defendants-Appellants an opportunity to\n\npurge the default.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the substituted Defendants-Appellants have prayed for\n\nsetting aside the inquiry under section 86 of the Civil Procedure Code only as a\n\nconsequential relief to the aforementioned main reliefs but not as a substantive\n\nrelief.

If\n\nthe judgment-creditor did not or could not make an application under Section\n\n325 in case of resistance, obstruction, hindrance, or ouster, they may make an\n\napplication under Section 337 within ten years for a fresh writ or re-issuance of\n\na writ, subject to Section 347.\n\nIn the case at hand, the date of the decree should be November 1, 2002. The\n\nfirst application to serve the decree on the Defendant was made on April 2,\n\n2003, well within the ten-year period, but it was not in order. As stated above in\n\nthis judgment, a decree in proper form was submitted by the Plaintiff only on\n\nNovember 1, 2011, after a long delay. Although the Plaintiff informed the Court\n\nthat the Defendant was passed away, the Court inadvertently ordered the decree\n\nto be served on the Defendant. Since it was the duty of the Court to enter the\n\ndecree, I am of the view that the ten-year period under Section 337 should\n\ncommence from the date the formal decree was entered, which was the date\n\nfrom which the Plaintiff could take steps to serve the decree on the Defendant.\n\n20\n\nConclusion\n\nIn light of the reasoning provided above, the Questions of Law raised are"

(47) The learned President\u2019s Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that (a) the ownership of\n\nthe Vessel remained with the Defendant at all times, (b) the management and control of the Vessel too remained with the Defendant, and (c) the Vessel was never sold and/or delivered to the Plaintiff, although the Vessel was made available to the Plaintiff for its use. It was therefore his submission that the transaction was not a typical sale of a good, and the requirements of Section 8 have not been satisfied. (48) In terms of Section 2(1) it is through a \u2018contract for the sale of a good' that the seller\n\neither transfers or agrees to transfer the property. The former is a sale and the latter is an agreement to sell. Therefore, as provided in Section 59, a \"contract for sale\" can include either a sale or an agreement to sell. An agreement to sell is not considered as a sale, rather it is considered as a contract for the sale of a good. (49) For Section 8 to apply, there are two elements that must be satisfied.

Narayanan Chettiar,\n\ndeciding that the application approach test should be preferred over the order\n\napproach test in deciding whether an order is a final or interlocutory order in\n\ncivil proceedings be revisited in this appeal.\n\n[27] SC Appeal No. 41/2015 was filed following a dismissal for non-compliance with\n\nan imperative provision of the Civil Procedure Code, and SC/CHC Appeal No.\n\n37/2008 arose from a dismissal on the ground of prescription. In both cases,\n\nthe lower courts upheld preliminary objections raised by the respective parties\n\nand dismissed the actions. As the questions of law raised in both cases were\n\nidentical, they were taken up together, and the Supreme Court delivered a single\n\nJudgment. In its Judgment dated 04/08/2017, the Supreme Court extensively\n\ndiscussed the decisions in Siriwardana vs. Air Ceylon Limited20, Ranjith\n\nvs. Kusumawathi21 and Rajendra Chettiar vs. Narayanan Chettiar22.\n\nPriyasad Dep, PC, CJ, observed:\n\n\u201cIn two cases before us orders are made in respect of points of law raised by\n\nthe parties.

It stated:\n\nif their decision whichever way it is given, will if it stands finally\n\ndispose of the matter in dispute, I think that for the purpose of\n\nthese rules it is final. On the other hand, if their decision, if given\n\nin one way, finally dispose of the matter in dispute, but if given\n\nthe other, will allow the action to go on, then I think it is not final,\n\nbut interlocutory\u201d\n\n[28] In both instances, upon consideration of the relevant judicial precedent, this\n\nCourt held that the Orders made by the respective Courts were interlocutory in\n\nnature. Accordingly, the proper course available to the aggrieved parties was to\n\ninvoke the jurisdiction of this Court by way of a Leave to Appeal application\n\nunder Section 754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, and not by way of an Appeal\n\nunder Section 754(1). Both Appeals were therefore dismissed.\n\n[29] In the present case, at the commencement of the trial, the Defendants raised a\n\npreliminary objection before the District Court, challenging the maintainability\n\nof the action. The objection was founded on the institution of Case No. 19530/L,\n\npreviously filed against the same Defendants, based on the same cause of action\n\nand in respect of the same land. The Defendants accordingly contended that the\n\npresent action constituted a duplication of proceedings. The Plaintiffs did not\n\nobject to the preliminary objection being raised at the commencement of the\n\nDefendants' case. Having considered the material placed before it, the District\n\nCourt, by Order dated 26/03/2007, upheld the objection and dismissed the\n\nsecond action on the ground that it was not maintainable.\n\nPage 16 of 18"

I conceive that an order is \u2018final\u2019 only\n\nwhere it is made upon an application or other proceeding which must,\n\nwhether such application or other proceeding fail or succeed, determine the\n\naction.

The Plaintiff-Respondent\n\nraised a question of law based on the plea of res judicata through estoppel,\n\nreferencing the Divisional Bench decision Appeal Nos. 101A/2009 and\n\n101B/2009 [SC HCCA LA 174/2008] (Rajendra Chettiar vs. Narayanan\n\nChettiar24).

(No. 2)26, Lord Guest\n\nstated, \u201cany party to such litigation as against any other party is estopped\n\nthe merits.\u201d\n\n[33] It is crucial to recognize that when the District Court dismissed the second\n\naction, it did not consider or resolve the rights and liabilities of the parties on\n\nthe merits, nor did it issue a final Judgment. By Order dated 26/03/2007, the\n\nDistrict Court inter alia, upheld the plea of res judicata by way of estoppel and\n\naccordingly dismissed the action. At the time the District Court made its Order,\n\nan Appeal against the Order in the first action was pending before the Court of\n\nAppeal. The Court held that although the Plaintiff admitted to filing the Appeal\n\nand undertook to withdraw it, the Plaintiff had failed to establish that the\n\napplication to withdraw the Appeal bearing No. C.A. 412/03 had been allowed,\n\nor that the Appeal had in fact been withdrawn.\n\n[34] Applying the application approach to the present case, it is evident that the\n\ndismissal of the Plaintiff\u2019s second action arose from a preliminary objection\n\ntaken at the commencement of proceedings. While the decision to uphold the\n\nobjection brought the action to an end, had the objection been overruled, the\n\nmatter would have proceeded to trial, leaving the parties\u2019 substantive rights yet\n\nto be decided. The decisive consideration is whether the Order necessarily\n\nconcludes the litigation irrespective of the outcome of the application. On this\n\ntest, the Order dated 26/03/2007 must be regarded as interlocutory.\n\n[35] Considering all the above circumstances, it cannot be said that the decision of\n\nthe District Court, in dismissing the second action, was final and conclusive\n\nbetween the parties on the merits so as to operate as a complete bar to further\n\nproceedings. Accordingly, I hold that the Order dated 26/03/2007 is not a Final\n\n26 1967 (1) AC. 853\n\nPage 18 of 18"

The Appellant, by way of reply submissions dated 23rd March 2010, vehemently\n\ndisputed this position, maintaining that P4 could not in law be construed as an\n\nassessment, and reiterating that the assessment was made only on 11th June 2008, well\n\nbeyond the period of three years.\n\n15. On 1st July 2010, a determination was issued under the delegated authority of the\n\nCommissioner General of Inland Revenue, which reduced the taxable income but did\n\nnot address the time-bar objection.\n\n16. By letter dated 6th July 2010, the Appellant communicated its dissatisfaction with this\n\ndetermination, as required under Section 138(1) of the Act. On 14th July 2010, by a\n\nletter, the Commissioner General communicated the reasons for the determination,\n\nindicating expressly that questions concerning the legal validity of the assessment\u2014\n\nincluding the issue of time bar\u2014would not be considered by him, as such matters were\n\nfor judicial determination.\n\n17.

The Court of Appeal, upon consideration of the pleadings and submissions, by its\n\njudgment dated 18th July 2014, dismissed the application.

It further held that no illegality or jurisdictional defect was apparent on the face of the\n\nrecord which warranted intervention by way of writ, that the plea of time bar was not\n\nraised at the earliest opportunity but was introduced belatedly, and that the\n\ndetermination of the Commissioner General reducing the assessment of the taxable\n\nincome did not disclose any error of law on its face that would justify the issuance of an\n\norder in the nature of a writ.\n\n21.

It is their contention that the Act\n\nintentionally separates these two steps and provides a time limit only for the first.\n\nstatutory period, it is free to send the notice to the taxpayer at any time thereafter.

Ifindthisposition ofthe Respondenttobe untenableandafundamental\n\nmisinterpretation of both the plain language of the statute and the foundational\n\nprinciples of Sri Lankan tax jurisprudence.\n\n32. The legal authority to charge, levy and collect tax is a creature of statute, and when the\n\nlegislature, in its wisdom, imposes a time-bar, it does so to provide certainty, finality,\n\nand a vested right to the taxpayer. The Respondent\u2019s defence, which hinges on the\n\nclaim that an assessment can be secretly completed and then notified at its\n\nconvenience, is a direct assault on these core principles.\n\n33. It is a fundamental precept of a just legal system that a public authority must act not\n\nonly within its statutory mandate but also with transparency and accountability. To\n\nallow the state to hold taxpaying entities in a state of perpetual uncertainty, to keep a\n\ntax liability in a secret departmental file, and to issue a demand at its leisure would be\n\nto subvert the very purpose of the law.\n\n34. The questions that fall to be determined on this branch of the case are whether the\n\nimpugned assessment was validly made within the period of three years prescribed by\n\nSection 134(5) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000, and to that end, whether the\n\nletter dated 25th March 2008 styled as an \u201cintimation\u201d could, in law, constitute an\n\nassessment so as to save the assessment from being time-barred.\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 12 of 28"

One of the earliest authorities in this jurisdiction is Commissioner of Income Tax v\n\nChettinad Corporation Ltd. (1954)1 where Gratiaen J. drew attention to the linguistic\n\ndistinction between an \u201cassessment\u201d and a \u201cnotice of assessment\u201d. Gratiaen J. explained\n\nthe position in the following terms:\n\n\u201cThe distinction between an \u2018assessment\u2019 and a \u2018notice of assessment\u2019 is thus\n\nmade clear: the former is the departmental computation of the amount of tax\n\nwith which a particular assessee is considered to be chargeable and the latter is\n\nthe formal intimation to him of the fact that such an assessment has been\n\nmade.\u201d2\n\n37. If this notion were to be accepted, it would mean that under the Inland Revenue Act No.\n\n38 of 2000, the Assessor is only required to make the internal computation within the\n\nstipulated three years, while being free to indefinitely delay the issuance of the Notice\n\nof Assessment.\n\n38. But this is not the scheme of the 2000 Act. Section 134(1) specifically provides that an\n\nAssessor may \u201cassess the amount \u2026 and shall by notice in writing require such person to\n\npay forthwith.\u201d The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d makes it clear that the duty to compute tax\n\nliability and the duty to issue notice are inseparably linked. The section treats them as a\n\nsingle statutory act, not as two independent steps.\n\n1 55 NLR 553\n\n2 ibid, at p. 556 (emphasis added)\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 13 of 28\n\n39.

Samarakoon C.J. emphasized that the purpose of requiring reasons, was to ensure that\n\nthe Assessor genuinely applied their mind to the taxpayer\u2019s return and reached a\n\ndefinite determination. His Lordship stated:\n\n\u201cThe primary purpose of the amending legislation is to ensure that the Assessor\n\nwill bring his mind to bear on the return and come to a definite determination\n\nwhether or not to accept it. It was intended to prevent arbitrary and grossly\n\nunfair assessments which many Assessors had been making as \u201ca protective\n\nmeasure\". An unfortunate practice had developed where some Assessors, due to\n\npressure of work and other reasons, tended to delay looking at a return till the\n\nlast moment and then without a proper scrutiny of the return, made a grossly\n\nexaggerated assessment. Under the amendment when an Assessor does not\n\naccept a return, it must mean that at the relevant point of time he has brought\n\nhis mind to bear on the return and has come to a decision rejecting the return.\n\nConsequent to this rejection, the reasons must be communicated to the\n\nAssessee\u2026 His reasons must be communicated at or about the time he sends his\n\nassessment on an estimated income.

This passage highlights two critical principles. First, the giving of reasons is not a mere\n\nprocedural formality; it is a substantive requirement ensuring that the assessment\n\nreflects a genuine, considered decision by the Assessor. Second, the timing of the\n\ncommunication is essential; reasons must accompany the notice of assessment at the\n\nmoment the assessment is sent; failing which, the remedial purpose of the legislation is\n\ndefeated. It is noted that in the case at hand, it was also the Appellant\u2019s position at the\n\nstage of appeal to the CGIR that sufficient reasons were not communicated for the\n\nrejection.\n\n46. The dissenting opinion, notably that of Sharvananda J. (as His Lordship was then),\n\ntreated the communication of reasons as a \"directory\" step, suggesting that an internal\n\nassessment could stand even if the reasons were communicated later. However, this\n\nview did not carry the force of binding precedent, while the majority\u2019s reasoning is\n\nbinding on this Court.\n\n47. As E. Gooneratne clearly sets out in his book \u2018Income Tax in Sri Lanka\u2019,\n\n\u201cMaking an assessment culminates in the notice on the person assessed.

The\n\nInspector of Taxes had signed a certificate in the official assessment book on 16th\n\nMarch 1970, but the notices were only served after 7th April 1970.

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,13 D.N.\n\nSamarakoon J. held that the operation of the time bar runs from the sending of the\n\nnotice of assessment, and not from the mere making of the assessment, unless a\n\nproper book or register is maintained to show clearly the date on which the assessment\n\nwas made. His Lordship therefore underscored that the notice of assessment itself must\n\nbe issued within the statutory period of limitation.\n\n56. His Lordship stated:\n\n\u201cHence, the argument of the Tax Appeals Commission in the present case\n\nthat the effective date for the commencement of the time bar is the date of\n\n\u201cmaking \u201cthe assessment not the date of sending the notice could have been\n\naccepted if there was a book or a register maintained by the Commissioner\n\nof Inland Revenue which will be evidence of the date of making of\n\nassessment\u201d.\n\n57. One must appreciate that the law\u2019s requirement for timely and proper notification of\n\ntax assessments is not just a formality; it protects the trust between the State and its\n\ncitizens. Taxes must be fair and not imposed arbitrarily, so that the rights and security\n\nof taxpayers are respected. This idea, that power should be balanced with fairness, is\n\none that has guided just governance for centuries.\n\n12 ibid, at p.30, 31\n\n13 CA Tax 26/2013, CA Minutes of 16th March 2022\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 19 of 28\n\n58.

Just as the bee draws only what it needs, leaving the flower\n\nunharmed to bloom again, so too must the State collect revenue in a manner that\n\nsecures its due without crippling the people who provide it. Taxation must be\n\nrestrained, imposed \u201cgently and without inflicting pain or hardship,\u201d so that both the\n\ngovernment and its citizens may endure and prosper together. The lesson is timeless,\n\nbut perhaps never more important than today.\n\n60. In today\u2019s economy, taxation is not merely a means for the State to raise revenue; it\n\nfunctions like the framework of a bridge that supports commerce and livelihoods.\n\nBusinesses, investors, and individuals build their plans upon it, expecting stability and\n\npredictability.

While it contains certain preliminary calculations, these workings\n\ncannot be framed as a final and binding determination of liability.\n\n65. The letter neither quantifies a conclusive sum payable nor calls upon the Appellant to\n\ndischarge such liability; specifies a date by when the amount shall be settled; nor does\n\nit set out the statutory right of appeal, which is an essential feature of a Notice of\n\nAssessment under Section 136. The computations appear as tentative workings to\n\nsupport the Assessor\u2019s non-acceptance of the return, rather than as the imposition of a\n\ncharge.

The Department must act, and must notify, within that time.\n\n68. There is a wider principle at stake, as I noted earlier. Taxation is a compulsory exaction\n\nbacked by the coercive power of the State. It is therefore imperative that the power to\n\ntax be exercised strictly in accordance with law, and within the boundaries the\n\nlegislature has drawn. Time bars in tax law are not technical traps for the Department;\n\nthey are jurisdictional limits imposed in the interests of certainty, fairness, and discipline.\n\n69.

The power to assess expired on the 31st March 2008 and\n\ncould not be revived thereafter.\n\n70.

At its core, this question concerns the proper role of the Court of Appeal in supervising\n\nadministrative action and ensuring that public authorities act within the limits of their\n\nlegal powers. The Constitution, under Article 140, clearly empowers the Court of Appeal\n\nto issue Writs of Certiorari as a safeguard to enforce the rule of law. The mere existence\n\nof a statutory appeal, which ordinarily addresses errors made within the lawful scope of\n\nauthority, does not limit or displace this constitutional power.\n\n74. I find the distinction between acts committed within jurisdiction and acts wholly\n\nwithout jurisdiction is fundamental. Appeals are designed to correct mistakes made\n\nwithin the authority granted by law, but acts performed outside the authority conferred\n\nby statute are nullities. No appeal can cure an action taken without legal power. As held\n\nin D.M.S. Fernando and Another v. Mohideen Ismail, where a similar contention was\n\nraised by the Deputy Solicitor-General, the Court held that:\n\n\u201dThere was another matter that was raised incidentally. It was contended by\n\nthe Deputy Solicitor\u2011General that the Respondent was not entitled to maintain\n\nthis application for Writ because an alternative remedy by way of appeal was\n\navailable to him under the Inland Revenue Act. Those provisions confine him\n\nto an appeal against the quantum of assessment. The Commissioner has not\n\nbeen given power to order the Assessor to communicate reasons. He may, or\n\nmay not, do so as an administrative act. The Assessor may, or may not, obey.\n\nThe Assessee is powerless to enforce the execution of such administrative acts.\n\nThe present objection goes to the very root of the matter and is independent of"

Commissioner General of\n\nInland Revenue,18\n\n\u201cHowever, judicial review may be granted in exceptional circumstances such as\n\nwhere the alternative statutory remedy is nowhere near so convenient,\n\nbeneficial and effectual or where there is no other equally effective and\n\nconvenient remedy. This is particularly so where the decision in question is\n\nliable to be upset as a matter of law because it is clearly made without\n\njurisdiction or in consequence of an error of law.\u201d19\n\n77. His Lordship further explained:\n\n\u201cAs judicial review is a collateral challenge and not an appeal, it will only be in\n\nexceptional circumstances that the courts will allow the collateral process of\n\njudicial review to be used to attack an appealable decision, when Parliament has\n\nexpresslyprovidedbystatuteanappellateprocedure.Butexceptional\n\ncircumstances may arise when it would be unjust for the taxpayer to appeal a\n\ndecision of the Commissioner \u2013 General. For example, if the Commissioner \u2013\n\nGeneral during the hearing acted illegally or ultra vires, then exceptional"

In aligning with these observations, I, too, am of the view that judicial review is not a\n\nsubstitute for statutory appeal, but serves as a necessary safeguard where the statutory\n\nprocess cannot adequately address the question of legality or jurisdiction. In the\n\npresent case, the Appellant challenged an assessment issued on 11th June 2008, after\n\nthe statutory deadline of 31st March 2008 under Section 134(5) of the Inland Revenue\n\nAct, 2000. The challenge was primarily not to the quantum of tax, but to the very\n\nauthority of the Commissioner General to issue the assessment, which had expired by\n\noperation of law.\n\n79. The statutory appeal mechanism is limited to correcting errors made within the\n\nCommissioner\u2019s lawful authority and cannot provide relief where the assessment itself\n\nis ultra vires or time-barred. Requiring the Appellant to proceed and to confine\n\nthemselves to the statutory appeal would have compelled it to participate in a process\n\nincapable of addressing the legal defect, even after the CGIR explicitly refused to\n\nconsider the time-bar in their reasons for determination marked \u2018P15\u2019 in the brief.\n\nIn such circumstances, where the statutory remedy would not have been practically\n\neffective for the Appellant, the requirements identified by Justice Aluwihare are met.\n\n80.

It is the contention of the Respondents that the act of appealing\n\namounts to an admission of the validity of the assessment and that the Appellant is\n\ntherefore precluded from thereafter denying its legality, which has been accepted by\n\nthe Court of Appeal.\n\n83.

    "chunk_text": "therefore precluded from thereafter denying its legality, which has been accepted by\n\nthe Court of Appeal.\n\n83. It is of my view that the Appellant\u2019s resort to the appellate procedure does not amount\n\nto an abandonment or waiver of its right to seek judicial review of a jurisdictional\n\ntime-bar in its appeal to the Commissioner-General and reiterated the same in\n\nsubsequent proceedings. That objection was not only recorded but was expressly\n\nacknowledged by the Commissioner-General, who stated in his determination that the\n\n21 [1985] 3 WLR 1090 at p. 1108\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 27 of 28\n\nissue of legal validity was a matter for the courts. This demonstrates that the Appellant\n\nnever accepted the validity of the assessment and preserved its right to seek judicial\n\nreview from the outset.\n\n84. The Respondents\u2019 claim of estoppel cannot stand. Estoppel requires two things: a clear\n\npromise or admission by one party, and the other party relying on it to their detriment.\n\nNeither is present here. The Appellant never accepted that the assessment was valid,\n\nand the Respondents never changed their position because of anything the Appellant\n\ndid. From the beginning, the Respondents insisted the assessment was within time, and\n\nthe Appellant consistently disputed that. There was never any conduct by the Appellant\n\nthat could be taken as an admission.\n\n85.More importantly, the plea of estoppel clashes with the very structure of the law. The\n\nstatute gives taxpayers a strict time-limit as a safeguard against late assessments. That\n\nprotection is substantive, not optional. To say it can be lost just because a taxpayer files\n\nan appeal would make the safeguard meaningless. It would mean that by using the\n\nremedies the law itself provides, a taxpayer could unintentionally breathe life into an\n\notherwise invalid assessment. Such a result would defeat the purpose of the limitation,\n\nand this Court cannot endorse it."

No\n\nchallenge had been made to Kalyanawathi on this point when she was giving\n\nexamination she made the unsolicited assertion that she never signed\n\n17\n\ndocuments in English, a statement clearly inconsistent with her admitted\n\nability to write her name in English, as well as with the evidence of the notary\u2019s\n\nclerk and the receipt P3 signed by her.\n\nMost tellingly, when it was put to her in cross-examination that her denial of\n\nhaving sold the land was false, the Appellant chose to remain silent (see page\n\n325 of the appeal brief). Such silence, when a direct suggestion of falsity was\n\nmade, can reasonably be taken as an implied admission. Her contradictory\n\nstance and evasive responses further undermine her credibility.\n\nIn the totality of circumstances, the evidence of the notary\u2019s clerk stands as\n\ncogent and credible proof of the due execution of Deed No.1530, while the\n\ntestimony and demeanour of the Appellant reveal several inconsistencies and\n\nan absence of candour.\n\nThe Appellant contends that relying on section 68 of the Partition Law that\n\nformal proof is not necessary but genuineness of the deed is impeached by a\n\nparty adversely claiming to the party producing the deed. The Appellant is an\n\nadversely who is challenging said deed. Further, relying on section 25(2) of\n\nthe partition law the Appellants contend that without filing a statement of\n\nclaim a party shall not be entitled to contest or dispute thus impeaching a\n\ndeed means challenging the said deed in the statement of claim and raising\n\nan issue challenging the deed.\n\nIn the circumstances, I am of the view that reliance on the provisions of the\n\nPartition Law alone cannot suffice to impeach a deed without proper\n\nprocedural compliance.

Whether the guarantee bond (P8) was a printed form that had several blanks\n\nthat were filled later with typewritten details.\n\n2. The lease agreement was neither shown or a Sinhala translation was given\n\nto the Appellant.\n\n3. Whether the lease agreement (P2) was lawfully terminated.\n\n1.

His principal argument is that, at the time of\n\nsigning, the bond contained only the printed text and the typewritten details\n\nwere inserted later.\n\n[9] The Appellant in his evidence has attempted to point out to the portions that\n\nwere subsequently inserted. While the precise portions of evidence were not\n\nmarked for the benefit of the Court, a careful reading of his evidence directs to\n\nPage 6 of 17\n\nsuch subsequent insertions to be the date of execution of the guarantee bond,\n\nthe reference number of the lease agreement, the personal details of the\n\nguarantors (entered below their respective signatures), and the name and\n\naddress of the lessee."

He takes up the position that, by\n\nleaving blank spaces in the guarantee bond to be filled later, the lender has\n\nmade a fundamental mistake which makes the agreement void.\n\n[13] However, it is noted that any subsequent insertion ipso facto would not render\n\na contract unenforceable, but rather enforceability would be determined by the\n\nnature of the alteration and the knowledge or consent of the executing party. A\n\ncontract can be vitiated where the insertion constitutes a material alteration\n\nthat fundamentally changes the obligations undertaken, or where the signature\n\nwas obtained by fraud or misrepresentation.\n\n[14] In the present case, it is not disputed that the Appellant executed the guarantee\n\nas surety of the 1st Defendant under the lease agreement. The nature of that\n\nobligation remained constant, irrespective of the fact that the particulars were\n\nsubsequently filled. The Appellant is a literate businessman, and has not alleged\n\nthat his signature was obtained by fraud or duress by the Respondent. His\n\nevidence was that he signed the printed form knowing it to be a guarantee.\n\nPage 7 of 17\n\nFurthermore, the lessee was known to the Appellant, and he has admitted that\n\nhe is related to him."

As\n\nheld in Pigot\u2019s Case (1614)1 it was established that such post-execution\n\nchanges could render an instrument void, the rationale being that no party\n\nshould be held to obligations materially different from those they agreed to\n\nwhen affixing their signature and seal. In its early application, the rule was\n\ninterpreted narrowly and applied strictly.\n\n[16] Over time the courts have refined the principle to reflect commercial realities.\n\nRecent authorities such as Raiffeisen Zentralbank \u00d6sterreich AG vs.\n\nCrossseas Shipping Ltd2, has explained that only alterations which are\n\n\u201cmaterial\u201d in nature will void a guarantee as against a non-assenting party.

The legal incidence of the contract of guarantee (and\n\nindemnity) was not altered by the insertions into cl. 37. The business effect of\n\nthe contract of guarantee (and indemnity), if used for any ordinary business\n\npurpose for which a contract of guarantee (and indemnity) is used, was not\n\naltered by the insertion into cl. 37.

In the present case, the evidence of Belan Daminda is that\n\nthe guarantors were verbally informed of the liability under the lease agreement\n\nbefore signing.

    "chunk_text": "Appellant has signed. He now contends that no translation of the lease\n\nagreement was in fact provided. The Respondent\u2019s witness clarified that the\n\npractice is to furnish guarantors with a translation of the guarantee bond which\n\ninstruments on the rubber stamp appears to be a standard form in which the\n\ninapplicable words were not struck out. Importantly, the Appellant has never\n\nasserted that he did not receive a translation of the guarantee bond itself.\n\nPage 13 of 17\n\n[29] As explained above, the law does not require that the lease agreement be\n\ntranslated for the guarantor, it is sufficient that he understands his\n\nresponsibilities under the bond. On the evidence, that requirement was met.\n\n1.3 Analysis\n\n[30] The 3rd Defendant-Appellant takes up the position that he is not liable to pay\n\nthe demanded sum since the guarantee bond was incomplete at the time he\n\nplaced his signature. The Appellant also contends that due to his inability to\n\nread and understand the English language, he required a Sinhala translation of\n\nthe Agreement, which was not given to him. Under cross-examination, the 3rd\n\nDefendant-Appellant refers to certain numbers in document P8, which he\n\nclaims include the typewritten parts.\n\n[31] The Respondent was obligated to explain to the guarantors the nature of the\n\ntransaction and the liability imposed on them in the event the principal debtor\n\ndefaults. It is evident that the 3rd Defendant-Appellant, as guarantor, was aware\n\nof the amount he was liable to pay to the lessor in the event of any default of\n\npayment of the obligated sum.\n\n[32] The Judge of the Commercial High Court, in the overall analysis of the evidence,\n\nconcluded that the 3rd Defendant-Appellant was aware that he signed P8 as a\n\nguarantor to the 1st Defendant, that the 1st Defendant had defaulted on payment,\n\nthat failure or neglect to pay the sum guaranteed or the return of \u201cthe property\u201d,\n\nthe liability was on the guarantor to pay its value on demand.

Weeramantry in \u2018Law of Contracts\u2019 states as follows:\n\n\u201cA person signing a document is held strictly to its terms on the basis that he\n\ndoes so at his peril. This is known as the caveat subscriptor rule, and in the\n\noperation of this rule the principles relating to justus error come into play.\n\nThis rule must not however be viewed as a special head of exemption from the\n\nordinary rules relating to mistake. Where a person deliberately affixes his\n\nsignature to a written contract, the court would naturally be more hesitant in\n\npermitting him to plead that he did so in consequence of a mistake as to the\n\nnature or substance of the transaction, and to this extent would be less prone\n\nto view the error as justus.\u201d4\n\n[36] I also wish to echo the opinion of A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J, in the judgement of\n\nNimalasena vs. L.B.

If he knew that the act of signing a\n\nguarantee would spell for him disastrous consequences of monetary burdens,\n\nhe should have exhibited prudence. So his assertion that he only signed as a\n\nwitness and not as a guarantor does not inspire confidence in this Court.

In\n\nsupport of this proposition, he cited the decisions in Bradford Old Bank v. Sutcliffe [(1918)\n\n2 KB 833], L.B. Finance v. Manchanayake [(2000) 2 Sri LR 142], Seylan Bank Ltd. v.

Dharmabandhu, Executive Officer. Along with\n\nhis affidavit, documents marked P1 to P6(d) was tendered in evidence. P6(b) was the\n\ndemand made on the 2nd Defendant. At the commencement of his examination-in-chief,\n\nCounsel for the 2nd Defendant moved that document marked P5 should be marked subject\n\nto proof. P5 was the Statement of Account. None of the other documents including P6(b)\n\nwere marked subject to proof.\n\nWhere no objection is taken when the document is sought to be tendered in evidence,\n\nand the document is not forbidden by law to be received in evidence, any objection to its\n\nreceipt as evidence is deemed to have been waived.

Even assuming that this\n\nwas a reference to documents marked P6(a), P6(b) and P6(c), it was an exercise in futility\n\nand an attempt to close the stable door after the horse has bolted.

On an objective reading of the arbitration\n\nclause as well as the Lease Agreement as a whole, the scope of the arbitration clause\n\ncovers only disputes between the Lessor and Lessee.\n\nNone of the parties to this action is a bank. The Lease Agreement is not part of a banking\n\ntransaction. Hence, the transaction between the parties in this action does not fall within\n\nBanks and Banking in Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance. The governing law of the Lease\n\nAgreement is Roman-Dutch law.\n\nPage 8 of 18\n\nThere was a general rule in early Roman law that a contract should not benefit or bind a\n\nthird party. This was known as alteri stipulari non potest. A stranger to a contract was\n\noutside the scope of the rights and duties arising thereunder. This rigid rule was subject\n\nto progressive modification in later Roman law.\n\nRoman-Dutch law did not adopt the strict approach of Roman law to third party rights.\n\nAccording to Grotius (3.3.38), Roman-Dutch law allows a third party to accept the promise\n\nand thus acquire a right unless the promisor revokes the promise before such acceptance\n\nby the third party. Similarly, a stipulation in a contract in favour of a third party can be\n\nenforced by such party where it has been accepted by him [Jinadasa v. Silva (34 NLR 344),\n\nDe Silva v. Margaret Nona (40 NLR 251), Marthelis Appuhamy v. Peiris (47 NLR 78].\n\nThe arbitration clause does not have any stipulation indicating that the 1st and 2nd\n\nDefendants as Guarantors are to benefit from it.\n\nMoreover, according to Roman-Dutch law, the obligation created thereunder is\n\nindependent of the obligations created under the Lease Agreement and the 2nd Defendant\n\ncannot rely on the scope of the arbitration clause contained in the Lease Agreement. Let\n\nme explain my conclusion.\n\nAccording to Weeramantry [The Law of Contracts, Vol. I, page 190], contracts which\n\ncharge a person with the debt, default or miscarriage of another are contracts of"

The defendant\n\nhad signed a document in which he guaranteed specific performance of the contract for\n\nthere was no principal obligation and no suretyship. The Court held that the clause\n\nresulted in an independent undertaking. The defendant had contracted as a co-principal\n\ndebtor and not surety. His undertaking was held not to be dependent upon the non-\n\nperformance of the purchaser but was in the form of an indemnity. Here the use of the\n\nword guarantee was construed to create an independent obligation and hence the\n\nundertaking was not a suretyship. Such result is not possible if one were to assume that\n\n\u201csuretyship\u201d and \u201cguarantee\u201d are interchangeable.\n\nSimilarly, in List v. Jungers [1979(3) SA 106 (A) at 117-119] the use of the word guarantee\n\nwas held by Court to mean an original undertaking whereby the promisor bound himself\n\nas principal debtor and not as surety.\n\nPage 10 of 18\n\nThese authorities support the statement in Caney\u2019s The Law of Suretyship [Forsyth &\n\nPretorius (eds.), 5th edition (Juta & Co. Ltd., 2002), page 27], that \u201cguarantee\u201d is a distinct\n\nalthough difficult concept and seeks to provide a precise definition and explore its\n\nrelationship with suretyship. Caney [supra. page 31] goes on to state that with a contract\n\nof guarantee, the guarantor undertakes a principal obligation to indemnify the promisee\n\non the happening of certain events.\n\nAccording to Caney [supra., page 32]:\n\n\u201cWhat then is the difference between a guarantee that a debtor will perform and\n\nsuretyship? Lubbe makes one point of distinction clear : the guarantor\u2019s obligation,\n\nas an obligation independent of that of the debtor, is to indemnify the creditor in\n\nrespect of losses suffered through the debtor\u2019s non-performance, whereas the\n\nsurety, as we have seen, is only liable for losses resulting from the debtor\u2019s breach"

It was rejected by the learned trial judge by his\n\norder dated 10.07.2012. Court held that although the Lease Agreement contained an\n\narbitration clause, there is no such clause in the Guarantee.

People\u2019s Bank and Others\n\n[S.C. Appeal (CHC) 43/2012, S.C.M. 11.10.2019 at page 21]:\n\n\u201cThe only question that arose in that case [Agostinu (supra)] was whether entries\n\nin the books of a banker have been proved in the manner prescribed in Section 90C\n\nof the Evidence Ordinance.\n\nIn a brief judgment, Basnayake C.J. held that, \"Section 90C does not apply to the\n\n'statements produced'. The only way of proving entries in a banker's book is by\n\neither producing the original or certified copies of the entries therein as prescribed\n\nby Section 90C\" (emphasis added).\n\nWhat was produced in Court in the case of Agostinu was a bare statement, without\n\nany certification, and based on some entries which had been certified by the\n\naccountant of the bank. It appears, then, that although the original entries of the\n\nbank had been certified by the accountant, the transcription of those entries that\n\nwas produced in Court carried no certification. Basnayake C.J. correctly held that\n\nthe statement was inadmissible in as much as it is a mandatory requirement under\n\nPage 15 of 18\n\nSection 90C, that what is produced in Court should be certified as stipulated in\n\nSection 90A of the Evidence Ordinance.\u201d\n\nIn Chandra Gunasekara (ibid.), the certificate read as follows:\n\n\u201c\u201cI, Uttumalebbe Ali Mohamed, Chief Manager-Special Assets Unit do hereby\n\ncertify that the foregoing statement is a true extract of the relevant entries relating\n\nto the current account No. 205002 of Wang Lanka Apparels (Pvt) Ltd., No. 86, Sea\n\nBeach Road, Colombo 11 as appearing in the books of the People\u2019s bank and that\n\nsuch entries are contained in one of the ordinary books of the Bank and were made"

Nonetheless,\n\neven when these requisites are satisfied, the contract may nonetheless\n\nbe void or voidable if vitiated by misrepresentation, mistake, duress,\n\nundue influence, or illegality. The Roman-Dutch legal tradition which\n\nunderpins Sri Lankan contract law similarly insists that consent must\n\n\u200b\u200b14\n\nbe free from error, force or fraud (Voet Commentarius ad Pandectas\n\n2.14.7), and our courts have consistently held that absence of\n\ngenuine consent undermines enforceability.\n\nTherefore, based on the established principles governing the law of\n\nContract, it is well established that the mere presence of offer and\n\nacceptance does not, of itself, suffice to constitute a valid and\n\nenforceable contract. The law further requires additional elements\n\nsuch as consideration or causa, an intention to create legal relations,\n\ncompliance with any prescribed form, and the legal capacity of the\n\nparties. Yet, even the concurrence of all these essentials does not\n\ninvariably guarantee the validity of the agreement. Where the\n\ntransaction is tainted by vitiating factors such as duress, the\n\npurported contract cannot, in law, be regarded as binding.\n\nIn Wimala Perera v.

Kalyani Siriyalatha [2011] 1 SLR 182,\n\nJustice Shiranee Tilakawardane affirmed that:\n\n\u201cIt is an elementary rule that every contract requires an offer\n\naccepted, is not actionable [vide Justice Weerasooriya in\n\nMuthukuda v. Sumanawathie 4 NLR 321 at 208, 209]. It has\n\nbeen stated that it is an elementary proposition of law that a\n\ncontract is concluded when in the mind of each contracting\n\nparty there is a consensus ad idem, Noorbhai v. Karuppan\n\nChetty (1925) 27 NLR 325 (per Lord Wrenbury). Cumulatively\n\ntherefore an intention to create a legal relationship and a\n\nconsensus ad idem or meeting of the minds needs to be in\n\nexistence in order to establish a contract between the parties.\u201d\n\nSoertsz J. in Edward Silva v. De Silva [1945] 46 NLR 510 also\n\nemphasised that, for a promise to be enforceable,\n\n\u200b\u200b15\n\n\u201cthe agreement must be a deliberate, serious act, not one that\n\nis irrational or motiveless.\u201d\n\nThese principles resonate with established common law doctrines. In\n\nBalfour v. Balfour [1919] 2 KB 571, Atkin LJ underscored that not\n\nall agreements are legally binding unless there is an intention to\n\ncreate legal relations, while in Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.\n\n[1893] 1 QB 256, the English Court of Appeal affirmed that where\n\nthere is a clear offer, acceptance, and consideration, coupled with an\n\nintention to be bound, the promise becomes enforceable. These\n\ncomparative authorities highlight that the bedrock of contractual\n\nliability lies in consensus ad idem, intention, and enforceability in law.\n\nIn the case of People\u2019s Bank v Ceylinco Insurance Company\n\nLimited [SC CHC Appeal 06/2003 decided on 11.02.2016] it was\n\nheld that,\n\n\u201cI am of the view that any Court is entitled to look into the\n\nsurrounding circumstances in order to identify the scope and\n\nobject of the guarantee bonds just as much as it would be\n\nentitled to look at the factual matrix as an aid to the"

Abdeen (57 NLR 1 at 3)]. I will\n\ntherefore briefly examine the availability of this remedy in Roman-Dutch law.\n\nIt is not clear whether specific performance was a remedy available in Roman law. Lee\n\nmakes contradictory statements in stating that decrees of specific performance were\n\nunknown [Lee R.W., The Elements of Roman Law, IV Edition, Sweet & Maxwell (1956),\n\n441] while later claiming that specific performance may be decreed [ibid. page 457].\n\nWeeramantry [The Law of Contracts, Vol. 2, (Lawman (India) Pvt., Reprint 1999) pgs. 952-\n\n953] explains that during the formulary period, Roman law did not compel specific\n\nperformance. It was sufficient for the payment of id quod interest. He opines that given\n\nthat the maxim of Roman law being nemo potest praecise cogi ad factum (no one can be\n\nPage 10 of 18\n\ncompelled to perform a specific act), it was unusual for the grant of the remedy of specific\n\nperformance.\n\nThere is a divergence of opinion among jurists of the availability of specific performance\n\nin Roman Dutch law.\n\nAccording, to Van Der Linden [1.14.7], where the obligation consists in performing a\n\nparticular act, the oblige may sue the obligor for the performance of that act, or\n\ncompensation in damages and interest.\n\nGrotius [3.3.41] states that although by natural law a person who has promised to do\n\nsomething is bound to do it if it is in his power, he may nevertheless by municipal law\n\nrelease himself by paying the other contracting party the value of his interest in the same\n\nor the penalty, if any, which has been agreed upon in default of payment."

Berry [(1912) AD 343 at 350] where Innes, J. held:\n\n\u201cPrima facie every party to a binding agreement who is ready to carry out his own\n\nobligation under it has a right to demand from the other party, so far as it is\n\nPage 11 of 18\n\npossible, a performance of his undertaking in terms of the contract. As remarked\n\nby KOTZE C.J., in Thompson vs. Pullinger (1 O. R., at p. 301), \u201cthe right of a plaintiff\n\nto the specific performance of a contract where the defendant is in a position to do\n\nso is beyond doub\u201d. It is true that Courts will exercise a discretion in determining\n\nwhether or not decrees of specific performance should be made. They will not, of\n\ncourse, be issued where it is impossible for the defendant to comply with them. And\n\nthere are many cases in which justice between the parties can be fully and\n\nconveniently done by an award of damages. But that is a different thing from\n\nsaying that a defendant who has broken his undertaking has the option to purge"

The plaintiffs alleged that on February 6, 1940, they tendered to the\n\ndefendant the sum of Rs. 6,325 in cash which the defendant did not receive. They\n\ninstituted action on February 7, 1940, for specific performance of the agreement to\n\nreconvey, but did not bring the money into Court until January 23, 1941, the day before\n\nthe date fixed for the hearing of the action. The Privy Council held, that the failure of the\n\nplaintiffs to bring the money into Court with the plaint was a very serious omission.\n\nThe reasoning of the Privy Council does not show per se an examination of the relevant\n\nprinciples of Roman-Dutch law. Nevertheless, it is a fundamental legal principle in Roman-\n\nDutch law that the party seeking to enforce a contract must be ready and willing to\n\nperform his part of the bargain. This necessarily leads to the conclusion that a party\n\nseeking to obtain specific performance of a contractual stipulation which is conditional\n\nPage 14 of 18\n\nupon the payment of a sum of money, must bring the amount due to Court and deposit\n\nit to the credit of the action at the time of filing the plaint."

The Plaintiff\n\nstates that if the reliefs sought by the Defendant were granted, it would leave the Plaintiff\u2019s\n\nbenefit.\n\nThe Plaintiff, placing reliance on the dicta in Mercin v Edwin [1984] 1 Sri L.R. 224, submits\n\nthat when a person establishes physical user of a right-of-way for the prescriptive method, he\n\nis entitled to succeed in a claim of prescriptive user and mere enjoyment of the right is proof\n\nPage 7 of 10\n\nof the adverse user. The Plaintiff contends that the Defendant has not successfully challenged\n\nor disputed the Plaintiff\u2019s use of the roadway since purchasing the land in 1970. The Plaintiff\n\nclaims rights not through a formal title but through prescription, asserting adverse use of the\n\nroadway against all others, including the Defendant, for over a decade before the District\n\nCourt case began. Additionally, the Plaintiff points to Surveyor\u2019s Plan No. 3159 (\u2018P1\u2019), which\n\nindicates that the disputed roadway is the only connection between \u2018Weerasinghe Mawatha\u2019\n\nand the Plaintiff\u2019s land, with the surveyor\u2019s testimony confirming the Plaintiff\u2019s undisturbed\n\nand continuous use of the roadway since taking possession of the land described in the 1st\n\nSchedule of the Plaint.\n\nA cogent argument of the Defendant is that the Plaintiff\u2019s title deed from 1970 (\u2018P8\u2019) and the\n\nDeed of Gift (\u2018P9\u2019) to his children in 1985 make no mention of any right-of-way.\n\nConsequently, the Defendant asserts that no right-of-way was conveyed through these deeds,\n\nand the Plaintiff failed to prove as to when the road usage began. Another aspect of the\n\nsubmissions made on behalf of the Defendant is that the Plaintiff\u2019s alleged \u201cunchallenged and\n\nuncontradicted\u201d 20-year residence in Australia undermines any claim to prescriptive rights\n\nover the disputed strip of land through usage.

The Defendant, placing reliance on Fernando v\n\nSumanatissa Thero 36 NLR 422 and Silva et al. v Kumarihamy 25 NLR 449 submits that the\n\nHigh Court as well as the District Court have erred in law by concluding that the Plaintiff has\n\nprescribed to the subject roadway shown in the said Plan No.255 (\u2018P3\u2019), which shows that the\n\nroadway was made in 1999 after the District Court action was instituted.

Thus, it is the Defendant\u2019s contention that even if there were occasional or incidental\n\nthe Plaintiff a legal right-of-way.\n\nTo claim prescriptive title, a plaintiff must meet three key legal conditions: first, their\n\npossession of the property must be continuous and undisturbed; second, this possession must\n\nbe independent of or adverse to the Defendant\u2019s title; and third, it must have lasted for at least\n\nten years immediately before the lawsuit. The principle of \"adverse user\" is fundamental to\n\nclaiming a prescriptive title. The law, however, provides a clear framework for establishing\n\nthis hostility through a well-defined shift in the burden of proof. At the trial, licensed surveyor\n\nKarunaratne Costa testified, confirming the existence of the roadway and its role as the only\n\naccess to the Plaintiff\u2019s land. Documentary evidence included Plan No. 3159 (\u2018P1\u2019), Plan No.\n\n255 (\u2018P3\u2019), and the Police Complaint (\u2018P7\u2019). The Plaintiff also presented a building plan (\u2018P10\u2019)\n\nand a sketch (\u2018P11\u2019), both of which identified the roadway as the access to the Plaintiff\u2019s block\n\nof land. Additionally, utility bills and assessment notices (\u2018P14\u2019 to \u2018P37\u2019) were submitted,\n\nshowing the property was consistently identified and assessed based on its access from\n\n\u2018Weerasinghe Mawatha\u2019. Substantial evidence presented to the District Court demonstrates\n\nthat the Plaintiff has been using the roadway from the outset, starting five years before the\n\nDefendant acquired his land.\n\nThus, upon an overall consideration of the evidence, I agree with the Trial Judge's conclusion\n\nthat the Plaintiff had uninterrupted use of the roadway since 1970, thereby establishing\n\ncontinuous possession.

This use, which began before the Defendant acquired the adjacent\n\nDefendant\u2019s rights.

The Defendant\u2019s failure to discharge this burden, compounded by the\n\nfact that the Plaintiff's use began before the Defendant owned the land, makes his arguments\n\nuntenable.\n\nThe Defendant\u2019s challenge to the continuity of possession, citing the Plaintiff\u2019s absence, is not\n\nstrong enough without proof that the possession of the roadway actually ceased.\n\nWigneswaran, J in Leisa and another v Simon and Another [2002] 1 Sri.

Based on the evidence\n\nadduced at the Trial, it cannot be assumed that the Plaintiff\u2019s possession was ousted due to\n\nhis alleged visit to Australia. No evidence was led to confirm that the Plaintiff\u2019s absence was\n\nnot temporary or that he could not return and re-enter the property at any moment, upon his\n\nchoice, without anybody\u2019s permission. Thus, the Defendant\u2019s argument that the prescription\n\nclaim would be untenable due to the Plaintiff leaving for Australia will fail as it lacks sufficient\n\nsupporting evidence on the above aspects.\n\nThe Plaintiff also sought a right-of-way of necessity as an alternative relief, which the District\n\nCourt granted and the High Court upheld.

This type of conduct on the part of the\n\nplaintiff must not be encouraged, for it amounts to an abuse of the Partition\n\nLaw.\n\n3\n\nSC/APPEAL/174/2015\n\nThere are several sections in the Partition Law that compel the plaintiff to\n\nbring all the parties who have some claim to the land. For instance, section\n\n5 of the Partition Law enacts that the plaintiff in a partition action shall\n\ninclude in his plaint as parties to the action all persons who, whether in\n\nactual possession or not, to his knowledge are entitled or claim to be entitled\n\nto any right, share or interest to, of, or in the land to which the action\n\nrelates, whether vested or contingent, and whether by way of mortgage,\n\nlease, usufruct, servitude, trust, life interest, or otherwise, or to any\n\nimprovements made or effected on or to the land. It is significant to note\n\nthat the duty of the plaintiff is not limited to including those who are in fact\n\nentitled to rights, but extends also to those who claim to be entitled or who\n\nhave effected improvements. The plaintiff in the present case manifestly\n\ndisregarded this statutory obligation.\n\nSince the second survey in 1997, 28 years have lapsed.

This kind of voluntary alienations are contrary to section 66 of\n\nthe Partition Law, and in my view the 59th defendant ought not to have been\n\nadded as a party. The 59th defendant filed no statement of claim.\n\nBy Journal Entry No. 111 dated 25.05.1995, the 59th defendant was\n\nsubstituted as plaintiff on the basis that the original plaintiff had sold his\n\nrights in the land to him.

The \ufb01rst was to order the reinstatement of the Applicant. Prior to exercising this op\u019fon, there are two ma\u01a9ers that must be considered. The \ufb01rst is whether reinstatement is expedient or appropriate in the circumstances of the case. If the answer is in the a\ufb03rma\u019fve, the second considera\u019fon is whether the Applicant should be reinstated with back wages, and if so, whether the Applicant was en\u019ftled to back wages from the date her services were terminated un\u019fl reinstatement or for a lesser period. If the Tribunal was of the view that reinstatement was not expedient or warranted, the second op\u019fon available to it was to award compensa\u019fon as an alterna\u019fve to reinstatement. In-built in this op\u019fon was to decide on the applicable criteria in determining the quantum of compensa\u019fon. Whether it be back wages or compensa\u019fon, the prime considera\u019fon is to redress the Applicant for the \ufb01nancial loss caused as a result of the unfair dismissal. 36) The decision whether the reinstatement of an employee is expedient or appropriate\n\nwould depend on the facts and circumstances peculiar to that case and may include the following:\n\n(i) The nature of the services performed by the employee;\n\n14\n\n(ii) The nature of the charges levelled against the employee; (iii) Whether any of the charges established at the domes\u019fc inquiry include\n\nmisappropria\u019fon of funds by the employee or fraud on the part of the employee; (iv) Whether the acts of misconduct alleged involve moral turpitude and/or gross"

Thus, the Labour Tribunal acted irra\u019fonally and clearly erred when it took into considera\u019fon an irrelevant fact. 42) The next ques\u019fon is, if not for the above error, did the facts of this case warrant an\n\norder for reinstatement. The answer to this ques\u019fon is twofold. The \ufb01rst is, present before the Tribunal was an employee who had ten years of unblemished service, but who stood unfairly accused of misinterpre\u019fng circulars and paying employees a salary over and above their en\u019ftlement whereas the payment thereof had been authorised by the Board of Directors of the Respondent and the Applicant had no role to play in that decision. This was aggravated by the fact that the Inquiry O\ufb03cer chose to ignore the said approval evidenced by the document E50 even though his a\u01a9en\u019fon was drawn to it. The second factor is that the Respondent did not lead any evidence to establish that the reinstatement of the Applicant would not be expedient or appropriate in the circumstances of this case. 43) With the age of the Applicant not being a bar to the Applicant being reinstated, and\n\nwith the Labour Tribunal not being concerned with any other ground that would make reinstatement inexpedient, there was no impediment to an order being made for the reinstatement of the Applicant. Thus, in my view, the Labour Tribunal erred\n\n17\n\nwhen it refused to order the reinstatement of the Applicant on the basis of the age of re\u019frement of the Applicant.

Thus, the High Court failed to appreciate that (a) as long as the Applicant was within the age of re\u019frement at the \u019fme of the Order, there was no legal impediment to the reinstatement of the Applicant, and (b) such remedy was the most just and equitable order that the Labour Tribunal could have made in the circumstances of this case. 49) The third ground is when it stated that the Applicant had sought compensa\u019fon in\n\nlieu of reinstatement, thus demonstra\u019fng that she is content with an order for compensa\u019fon as opposed to reinstatement.

But Parliament cannot, by a constitutional\n\namendment, give itself a blanket authorisation to affect an entrenched\n\njurisdiction by means of a subsequent ordinary law. For example,\n\nParliament cannot confer an entrenched jurisdiction of this Court (e.g.\n\nunder Articles 125 to 127) on High Courts, by an Act passed under and\n\nin terms of Article 154P(3). However, the jurisdiction of the Court of\n\nAppeal under Article 138 is not an entrenched jurisdiction, because\n\nArticle 138 provides that it is subject to the provisions \u201cof any law\u201d;\n\nhence it was always constitutionally permissible for that jurisdiction to\n\nbe reduced or transferred by ordinary law (of course, to a body entitled\n\nto exercise judicial power).

By way of illustration, section 74(2) of the Primary Courts\u2019\n\nProcedure Act No. 44 of 1979, expressly provides that no appeal lies against\n\nan order made under section 66 of that Act. In such circumstances, an\n\naggrieved party may invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial\n\nHigh Court to challenge such orders.\n\nSince section 9 of Act No. 19 of 1990 states that appeals to the Supreme\n\nCourt lies against judgments and orders made by the Provincial High Court\n\n\u201cin the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction\u201d, in cases such as Gunaratne v.\n\nThambinayagam [1993] 2 Sri LR 355, Abeygunasekera v.

In the impugned\n\norder, the Court of Appeal, following Gunawardane v. Muthukumarana\n\njurisdiction on the basis that it is distinct from its appellate jurisdiction. I\n\nam unable to agree with that view.\n\nConsider, for instance, a situation in which a Provincial High Court, in the\n\nexercise of its appellate jurisdiction, enters judgment for the plaintiff. Two\n\ndefendants, independently contesting the case, thereafter pursue divergent\n\nappellate remedies: one appeals to the Supreme Court with leave obtained,\n\nwhilst the other files a revision application before the Court of Appeal. If the\n\nSupreme Court were to affirm the judgment of the Provincial High Court\n\nwhile the Court of Appeal were simultaneously to set it aside, the result\n\nwould be an untenable jurisdictional conflict. Such a situation would not\n\nonly create inconsistency and uncertainty in the administration of justice,\n\nbut would also erode the hierarchical finality envisaged by the Constitution,\n\nwhich recognises the Supreme Court as the apex judicial body.\n\nRecognition of such a practice would also encourage \u201cjudge shopping\u201d or\n\n\u201cforum shopping\u201d to secure a favourable forum, which a Five Judge Bench\n\nof this Court in JMC Jayasekara Management Centre (Pvt) Limited v.\n\nCommissioner General of Inland Revenue [2024/25] BLR 557 at 566\n\nemphatically declared \u201cmust be stopped at any cost\u201d.\n\n29\n\nSC/APPEAL/65/2025\n\nAt the hearing before this court, it was submitted that the reason for filing\n\nthe application in revision and restitutio in integrum before the Court of\n\nAppeal was the plaintiff\u2019s desire to secure an early resolution of the matter,\n\ngiven the heavy workload of this court.

Both must therefore be construed in a consistent manner.\n\nIn Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd v. Perera [2012] BLR 14, the defendant\n\nfiled a revision application before the Court of Appeal against an order made\n\nby the Provincial High Court in the Western Province established by the\n\nHigh Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996. The\n\nSupreme Court held that, following the enactment of that Act, a person\n\ndissatisfied with any judgment or order of a Provincial High Court\n\nestablished thereunder may appeal only to the Supreme Court in terms of\n\nsection 5, and that the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to entertain an\n\nappeal or revision application against a judgment or order pronounced by\n\nsuch a Provincial High Court. Suresh Chandra J., with the concurrence of\n\nMarsoof J. and Ekanayake J., observed at page 18:\n\nThe sequence of the enactment of the Acts makes it evident that in\n\nrelation to a matter in the District Court the Right to Appeal from a\n\njudgment would be to the Court of Appeal and then if leave is granted\n\nan appeal would lie to the Supreme Court. By the enactment of Act\n\nNo.10 of 1996 it is clear that in any civil matter dealt with in the High\n\nCourt, the Right of Appeal lies only to the Supreme Court. This seems\n\nto be the clear intention of the Legislature with regard to matters dealt\n\nin the High Court. When the above special provisions are being\n\nconsidered in the High Court, if revisionary jurisdiction to the Court of\n\nAppeal is given then it would give the party applying for revision in a\n\n40\n\nSC/APPEAL/65/2025"

If the\n\nProvincial High Courts were entirely devoid of restitutio in integrum\n\njurisdiction, the statutory authority to transfer such applications would be\n\nrendered meaningless, and the receiving court would lack competence to\n\ndetermine the matter.

In that case,\n\nat page 310, this court held as follows:\n\nSection 9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No.\n\n19 of 1990, as amended, does not oust the revisionary jurisdiction of\n\nthe Court of Appeal in respect of decisions made by a Provincial High\n\nCourt exercising its appellate powers.

Such conduct falls squarely within the prohibition under Article 11.

Article 13 (1) of the Constitution reads as follows:\n\n\u201cNo person shall be arrested except according to procedure established by law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest.\u201d\n\nPage 8 of 10\n\nIn Dissanayaka v Superintendent Mahara Prison and others, Kulatunga, J. stated the following to highlight the importance of examining the material to decide the validity of the arrest.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, it is for the Court to determine the validity of the arrest objectively. The Court will not surrender its judgement to the executive for if it did so, the fundamental right to freedom from arbitrary arrest secured by Article 13(1) of the Constitution will be defeated. The executive must place sufficient material before the Court to enable the Court to make a decision, such as the notes of investigation, including the statements of witnesses, observations etc. without relying on bare statements in affidavits\".

Attorney General and Others the Court held that,\n\n\u201cHowever the officer making an arrest cannot act on a suspicion founded on mere conjecture or vague surmise. His information must give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the suspect was concerned in the commission of an offence for which he could have arrested a person without a warrant.

I am of the opinion that the sequence of events, including the failure to produce the Petitioner before the JMO immediately after arrest, the contradictory medical reports and the corroborative affidavits of eyewitnesses, casts significant doubt on the veracity of the version set out in the Police B Report. While the report suggests that the Petitioner was lawfully apprehended with heroin in his possession, the surrounding circumstances strongly suggest that there is good reason to doubt the validity of the report. Further, the second JMO report also claims that there was no history of drug abuse, therefore the fact that the Petitioner had in his possession what is perceived to be is highly unlikely, thereby further invalidating the nature of the\n\nPage 9 of 10"

I am of the opinion that the sequence of events, including the failure to produce the Petitioner before the JMO immediately after arrest, the contradictory medical reports and the corroborative affidavits of eyewitnesses, casts significant doubt on the veracity of the version set out in the Police B Report. While the report suggests that the Petitioner was lawfully apprehended with heroin in his possession, the surrounding circumstances strongly suggest that there is good reason to doubt the validity of the report. Further, the second JMO report also claims that there was no history of drug abuse, therefore the fact that the Petitioner had in his possession what is perceived to be is highly unlikely, thereby further invalidating the nature of the\n\nPage 9 of 10\n\nJUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT\n\nPage 10 of 10\n\nYasantha Kodagoda, PC, J\n\nI agree.\n\nJUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT\n\nJanak De Silva, J I agree.\n\nJUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT"

The Respondent, by observations tendered on or\n\nabout 30/05/2008, admitted having been retained by the Complainant\n\nand acknowledged the receipt of professional fees.

The Supreme Court, in\n\nexercising its disciplinary jurisdiction under Section 42(2) of the\n\nJudicature Act No. 2 of 1978, must therefore act not only to censure the\n\nindividual but also to safeguard the collective integrity of the Bar.\n\n28. The Respondent\u2019s conduct, as found by the Disciplinary Committee,\n\nconstitutes a breach not only of specific rules, but of the very ethos of the\n\nprofession. The failure to act with diligence and honesty, particularly in\n\nfiduciary matters, is not a mere lapse, it is a betrayal of the professional\n\noath.\n\n1 A. R. B. Amerasinghe, Professional Ethics and Responsibilities of Lawyers (1993 Stamford Lake), p3 2 ibid, p 12 3 ibid, p 601\n\nPage 9 of 10\n\n29. The Respondent\u2019s conduct, which amounted to deceit and malpractice,\n\nhas eroded the confidence that clients and the public are entitled to place\n\nin Attorneys-at-Law. Such conduct is \u201cinexcusable and deplorable\u201d4 and\n\nmust be met with the full force of disciplinary sanction.\n\n30. In SC Rule No. 05/20225, this Court observed that the Respondent\u2019s\n\nfailure to file proper pleadings and maintain accurate records of client\n\nfunds deemed \u201cgross ineptitude and negligence\u201d, underscoring the\n\nimperative that Attorneys must act with scrupulous care and due\n\ndiligence.\n\n31. In Dhammika Chandratileke v. Susantha Mahes Moonesinghe,\n\ncited in SC Rule No. 04/20246, and in SC Rule No. 05/20227, this Court\n\nheld that \u201cAn attorney whose misconduct is criminal in character\u2026\n\nmay be struck off the roll\u2026 even though he had not been brought\u2026\n\nbefore a court of competent criminal jurisdiction and convicted.\n\n32.
