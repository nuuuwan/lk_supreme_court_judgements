Section 3(1) of Act No. 8 of 2024 contains a definition of contempt of court, which\n\nprovides that, any \u201cact or omission with the intent to - (a) bring the authority of a court, tribunal or institution and administration of justice into disrespect or disregard; or (b) interfere with, or cause grave prejudice to the judicial process in relation to any ongoing litigation\u201d shall amount to the commission of contempt of a court, tribunal or institution.\n\n31. Furthermore, section 3(2) of the Act contains a detailed list of instances which are\n\ndeemed to amount to different manifestations of contempt of court. One such instance as contained in paragraph \u2018(a)\u2019 of section 3(2) is the \u201cwillful disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a court, tribunal or institution\u201d."

Furthermore, it appears from the script of \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d that Shakespeare contrasts the authority of earthly rulers with the higher virtue of mercy. Moreover, he advances this view by linking mercy to the divine by describing mercy as an attribute of God himself. This in my view elevates mercy above human law and conduct. He frames mercy as a reflection of divine grace, with which I find myself in agreement. 56. In the real world, it is seen that mercy is exercised by (i) all-powerful monarchs, (ii)\n\nmonarchs who do not possess executive power and therefore are called upon by law or convention to act on the recommendations of the Head of the government (in the grant of clemency), and by (iii) human-beings acting in their personal capacities in\n\nSC/ CONTEMPT/ 03/ 2025 - JUDGMENT 28"

A change can therefore result in arbitrariness creeping into the selection process and affect the outcome of such selection process, and result in the violation of the equal protection of the law that a citizen is entitled to. Where a public authority considers that a change is desirable in order to give effect to a change in policy, those who are to be affected must be afforded an opportunity of expressing their views and concerns relating to such change and why such change should not be applied to them. 10) On the face of it, the change in the marking scheme from P7 to P13 and, more\n\nparticularly the failure to apprise the Petitioner and other applicants of such change can result in the Petitioner being denied the equal protection of the law.

Gajaweera and Others v Professor Siri Hettige, Chairman,\n\nNational Police Commission and Others [SC (FR) Application No. 14/2017; SC minutes of 20th March 2024], \u201cA fundamental requirement inherent in a fair selection process is the need to maintain transparency throughout all stages of recruitment and promotion.\u201d Thus, I am of the view that any change to the scheme laid down in P7 ought to have been formally announced within the 1st Respondent and especially to those who had responded to P7. Quite apart from maintaining\n\n10\n\ntransparency in the selection process and not shifting the metaphorical goal posts, an announcement was important for the reason that the advantage that the Petitioner received by being allotted ten additional marks for seniority was partially negated by not allotting marks for the ICASL Certificate. Such an adjustment would not have been contemplated by the Petitioner when she signed 3R1. 29) However, given the nexus between the two grounds urged by the learned"

The first defendant therefore has no title\n\nwhatsoever to the land in dispute.\u201d\n\nHaving considered the above settled law, I am of the view that the deed X-02\n\nunder which the petitioner-appellants have claimed title to the subject\n\nmatter of the partition action, even if it was a deed relating to the same\n\ncorpus, has no force or avail in law as rightly determined by the learned\n\nJudges of the High Court.\n\nThe learned Judges of the High Court have observed that even the deeds\n\nexecuted subsequent to the final land settlement order and its publication in\n\nthe Gazette X-03 by the 1st petitioner-appellant have not referred to the\n\nrelevant order published in the Gazette, whereas it should have been. On\n\nthe contrary, all the deeds relied upon by the plaintiffs and the defendants\n\nin the partition action have been executed after the publication of X-03,"

On\n\nthe contrary, all the deeds relied upon by the plaintiffs and the defendants\n\nin the partition action have been executed after the publication of X-03,\n\nsource of title, which is a matter that should be considered relevant in an\n\napplication in revision.\n\nMoreover, the fact that whether there was a duty cast upon the plaintiff of\n\nthe partition action to make the petitioner-appellants parties to the action\n\nhad also been drawn the attention of the learned Judges of the High Court.\n\nIt has been observed that the land sought to be partitioned is different from\n\nthe land claimed by the petitioner-appellants, by name, extent, and the folio\n\nin which they are registered. It has been observed that the deed relied upon\n\nby the petitioner-appellants (X-02) refers to a land called Debaragala Yaya,\n\nregistered in folio B.221/73 and the land sought to be partitioned by the\n\nplaintiff of the partition action is a land called Milagalayaya alias\n\nMillagalayaya, registered in a separate folio D.289/8. Therefore, the plaintiff\n\nof the partition action had no duty to make the appellants parties unless the\n\npetitioner-appellants on their own wanted to do so. It has also been\n\nPage 17 of 17\n\ndetermined that the petitioner-appellants have no basis to claim prescriptive\n\ntitle as well.\n\nI find that the above observations and determinations are matters that need\n\nconsideration when an application for the exercise of the discretionary\n\nremedy of revision is before a competent Court, of which I find no reasons to\n\ndisturb.\n\nIt appears that the petitioner-appellants have made an attempt to qualify\n\nthemselves under the proviso of section 8 of the Land Settlement Ordinance\n\nby claiming fraud on the part of the plaintiff of the partition action on the\n\nbasis that it discloses exceptional circumstances. However, I find no such\n\nfraud as claimed that has occasioned a miscarriage of justice."

The plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to explain this discrepancy as to their claimed title.\n\nPage 14 of 18\n\nIf they were indeed brothers as it appears, contrary to the claim by the\n\nplaintiffs that they are father and son, the plaintiffs\u2019 title pleaded based on\n\ninheritance shall fail since they have failed to establish the inheritance they\n\nclaimed.\n\nIt is my considered view that in a rei vindicatio action, proving of title to the\n\nsubject matter of an action includes the proper identification of the land for\n\nwhich a plaintiff is claiming title.\n\nI am in agreement with the submissions of the learned President\u2019s Counsel\n\non behalf of the 2nd plaintiff, that in terms of Section 41 of the Civil Procedure\n\nCode, when a claim is made in an action for some specific part of a land or\n\nsome share or interest in a specific portion of land, then the portion of land\n\nmust be described in the plaint so far as possible by reference to physical\n\nmetes and bounds or by reference to a sufficient sketch, map or plan\n\nappended to the plaint and not by name only.\n\nHowever, it is also my view that whether stating as such in a plaint would be\n\nsufficient to succeed in an action in the nature of a rei vindicatio would depend\n\non facts and circumstances specific to each case.\n\nThe case under appeal is a matter where there has been no admission as to\n\nthe corpus. It is true that the plaintiffs have described the land in question in\n\nrelation to a final partition plan that was prepared in the year 1942. The plaint\n\nin this action has been filed in the year 1993, more than five decades after the\n\nfinal partition plan was prepared."

This appeal was heard on\n\n02.11.2022 and as such was pending when the Act No. 17 of 2022 became law. Section 3\n\nof that Act applies and accordingly Deed No. 7216 (P6) must be admitted in evidence.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, I answer Question of Law No. 4 in the negative. Accordingly,\n\nQuestion of Law No. 1 does not arise for consideration.\n\nPage 8 of 9\n\nQuestion of Law No. 3\n\nThe Appellant submits that the Honourable Judges of the Provincial High Court (Civil\n\nAppeals) of the Western Province (Holden at Gampaha) erred in not considering at all the\n\ndocuments marked P8, P9, P10 and P11.\n\nAccording to the Appellant, he borrowed Rs. 60,000/= from the Respondent and Deed No.\n\n7216 (P6) was executed as security for this loan but it was fraudulently prepared as an\n\noutright transfer. Documents marked P8, P9, P10 and P11 prove that the Appellant had\n\npaid certain sums of money from this loan.\n\nNevertheless, the Respondent has explained the circumstances leading to the issuance of\n\nP9, which is a receipt issued by the Respondent for Rs. 1800/=.

Allowing for differences in the system of pleading,\n\nthis answer will apply equally to the Roman Law, the Dutch Law, and the law\n\nof this Colony. In regard to the Roman system of civil process it is well known\n\nthat the mode of procedure underwent great changes from the early times of\n\nRome to the time of Justinian. Throughout these changes, however, it was\n\nalways considered necessary that the time when a contested right was to be\n\nconsidered as really made the subject of litigation should be carefully marked.\n\nIn the time of Justinian an action was begun with the denunciatio actionis, by\n\nwhich the plaintiff announced to a magistrate that he wished to bring an\n\naction. and furnished a short statement of his case. This statement might be\n\noral or in writing, and was sent by the Magistrate, through a bailiff of the\n\nCourt, to the defendant. The parties or their procurators appeared before the\n\nMagistrate, and he then and there decided the case. (...)

In summary causes\n\n(such as actions for a decree of civil imprisonment, or for a decree of perpetual\n\nsilence) there was not much difficulty, for as soon as the defendant had\n\nobjected to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the litis contestatio was held to have taken\n\neffect (....), for the Court might then hear and decide the case without further\n\npleadings.\n\nAgain, a kind of fictitious litis contestatio was, according to Voet, admitted"

In ordinary defended cases, however, the rule was that the litis\n\ncontestatio was not complete until after duplicatio was pleaded (...) - Now the\n\nduplicatio or duplique of the Dutch law corresponds with the rejoinder of our\n\nlaw (...) the-litis- contestatio in an ordinary defended suit may be considered to\n\ntake place as soon as the pleadings are closed.\" [Emphasis Added]\n\nAccordingly, in an action where the Defendant appears before the Court, litis\n\ncontestatio occurs when the Defendant pleads. However, in a case where the\n\nDefendant defaults, litis contestatio takes effect at the time of the Defendant\u2019s\n\ndefault.\n\nDespite the fact that the reasons for the original Defendant\u2019s default were\n\nwithin the knowledge of the substituted Defendants in this case, the argument\n\nthat the reasons for the default lie solely within the personal knowledge of the\n\nDefendant is devoid of merit in law. It is a well-established rule that, even in an\n\naction in personam, an heir is bound by his predecessor in interest once the\n\naction has reached the stage of litis contestatio.\n\nOnce an heir is substituted in a case, they cannot alter or modify the position\n\nheld by the deceased predecessor. Proceedings before the Court must continue\n\nfrom the point where the predecessor left them. Procedural rules should not\n\nobstruct justice or legitimize any injustice. In such circumstances, the\n\nPetitioner\u2019s only available course of action is to file an application to set aside"

This\n\nwas a fact which the District Judge was completely ignorant of when delivered\n\nthe order depriving the substituted Defendants-Appellants an opportunity to\n\npurge the default.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the substituted Defendants-Appellants have prayed for\n\nsetting aside the inquiry under section 86 of the Civil Procedure Code only as a\n\nconsequential relief to the aforementioned main reliefs but not as a substantive\n\nrelief. This misunderstanding could have been easily avoided if the substituted\n\nDefendants-Appellants were mindful to plead alternatively to continue with the\n\npurge default inquiry in case their main reliefs were not granted.\n\nThe learned High Court Judges observed that the learned District Judge has\n\nmade the order for the substitution of the Defendant under wrong section,\n\nwhich was Section 341, when in fact the substitution should have done under\n\n18\n\nsection 398 of the Civil Procedure Code. Nonetheless such accidental slip by\n\nthe District Judge would not make the order per se devoid of law as long as the\n\nCourt has the authority to issue such an order, the reasoning to which I am\n\ninclined to agree.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that learned High Court Judges\n\nwere correct in upholding the validity of the substitution of Defendants in place\n\nof the deceased original Defendant, though his subsequent finding to deprive\n\nthe Defendants to purge their default under section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure\n\nCode is incorrect.\n\nWrit of Execution: Possibility of Issuance After Ten Years from Decree\n\nAlthough this point was not contested, the question arises as to whether a writ"

    "chunk_text": "the Defendants to purge their default under section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure\n\nCode is incorrect.\n\nWrit of Execution: Possibility of Issuance After Ten Years from Decree\n\nAlthough this point was not contested, the question arises as to whether a writ\n\ndecree.\n\nSimply stated, in terms of Section 337(1), no application to execute a decree\n\nshall be allowed after ten years from the date of the decree, or, if there was an\n\nappeal, after ten years from the date on which the decree was affirmed on\n\nappeal. In cases where the decree or any subsequent order directs the payment\n\nof money in installments or the delivery of property on a specified date, the\n\nten-year period is calculated from the date of default in making such payment\n\nor delivering such property.\n\nHowever, as per section 337(2) of the Civil Procedure Code if the judgment-\n\ndebtor has by fraud or force prevented the execution of the decree within that\n\nperiod, the rigidity of this rule is relaxed. In such circumstances, the ten year\n\nperiod begins to run from the date of removal or cessation of such malady or\n\ndisability.\n\nIf the aforementioned statutory bar applies to this case, any consequential steps\n\ntaken following this judgment would be futile.\n\nIn the Supreme Court case of Mohamed Azar v. Idroos,25 Amaratunga J. held:\n\n25 [2008] 1 Sri LR 232 at 241.\n\n19\n\n\u201cThe time bar prescribed by section 337(1) commences to operate only from\n\nthe date on which the judgment creditor becomes entitled to execute the writ,\n\nand as such it has no application to a case where the judgment creditor is\n\nprevented by a rule of law from executing the writ entered in his favour. The\n\ntime bar will apply in cases where the judgment creditor after becoming\n\nentitled to obtain the writ has slept over his rights for ten years\n\nUnder Section 337(3), which was introduced by Act No. 53 of 1980, a writ of\n\nexecution remains in force for one year from the date of issuance. It may be\n\nrenewed before its expiration for another year from the date of such renewal,"

It may be\n\nrenewed before its expiration for another year from the date of such renewal,\n\nmay be issued until the decree is satisfied, provided the application is made\n\nwithin the ten-year period mentioned above. Before the said amendment, once\n\nan application to execute a decree had been allowed under Section 337(1), no\n\nsubsequent application could be made unless the Court was satisfied that \u2018due\n\ndiligence\u2019 had been exercised on the last preceding application to procure\n\ncomplete satisfaction of the decree. However, this requirement was removed by\n\nthe aforesaid amendment. Irrespective of due diligence, the judgment-creditor\n\nmay now make successive applications for writs until the decree is satisfied. If\n\nthe judgment-creditor did not or could not make an application under Section\n\n325 in case of resistance, obstruction, hindrance, or ouster, they may make an\n\napplication under Section 337 within ten years for a fresh writ or re-issuance of\n\na writ, subject to Section 347.\n\nIn the case at hand, the date of the decree should be November 1, 2002.

I shall refer to these admissions later in this judgment as they played a pivotal role in the Plaintiff establishing its case before the High Court. The Defendant had also annexed to its answer documents marked D1 \u2013 D7 which included correspondence between the parties. (11) The Defendant took up the position that \u201cthe whole transaction was based on\n\n2007, it was able to find a buyer for the Vessel only in January 2008, and that too for a sum of USD 5,960,000 less 4% paid as sales commission, which was lower than the price that it had agreed with the Plaintiff. The Defendant therefore took up the position that as a result of the alleged wrongful termination by the Plaintiff it had suffered a loss of USD 628,000, that being the difference between the agreed sale price and the actual price for which it was sold.\n\n6\n\n(13) The Defendant had stated further that between the handing over of the Vessel to\n\nthe Defendant and the subsequent sale of the Vessel, the Defendant had maintained the Vessel and that it suffered an operational loss of a sum of USD 999,905 during this period. Together with the claim for the aforementioned USD 628,000, the Defendant had claimed in reconvention the said sum of USD 999,905. The trial, judgment of the High Court and the grounds of appeal (14) The Plaintiff had initially filed an affidavit of its Company Secretary, Abdul Aziz Arain.\n\nHaving been cross examined partially, the Plaintiff had informed Court that the witness is suffering from a terminal illness and is unable to be present any further to give evidence. The High Court had therefore directed that his evidence be struck off. (15) The Plaintiff had thereafter filed an affidavit of its In-house Legal Counsel, Rustom"

Section 151A(3) provides that in such event, the Court may make a ruling on such objection, prior to the witness being cross examined by the opposite party, thus making it clear that the Court is vested with a discretion whether to make a ruling at that stage or permit the witness to be cross examined, and for a decision to be made thereafter.

(as he then was),\n\nhaving discussed several other decisions, applied a four-point test to determine\n\nwhether an Order had the effect of a final Judgment, and to qualify to be a\n\nJudgment under Section 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code, held;\n\n\u201cit must be an order finally disposing of the rights of the parties.\n\n7 n (2) 8 n (1) 9 n (2) 10 [1903] 1 KB 547 11 n (1) 12 n (5) 13 n (2)\n\nPage 12 of 18\n\nThe order cannot be treated to be a final order if the suit or action is still left\n\nalive suit or action for the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of\n\nthe parties in the ordinary way\n\nThe finality of the order must be determined in relation to the suit\n\nThe mere fact that a cardinal point in the suit has been decided or even a vital\n\nand important issue determined in the case, is not enough to make an order, a\n\nfinal one.\u201d\n\n[24] In Ranjith vs. Kusumawathie14 Deeraratne J., having examined a line of\n\nJudgments from the English Courts, observed that;\n\n\u201c\u2026there have been two virtually alternating tests adopted by different judges\n\nfrom time to time in the UK to determine what final orders and interlocutory\n\norders were.

By Order dated 26/03/2007, the\n\nDistrict Court inter alia, upheld the plea of res judicata by way of estoppel and\n\naccordingly dismissed the action. At the time the District Court made its Order,\n\nan Appeal against the Order in the first action was pending before the Court of\n\nAppeal. The Court held that although the Plaintiff admitted to filing the Appeal\n\nand undertook to withdraw it, the Plaintiff had failed to establish that the\n\napplication to withdraw the Appeal bearing No. C.A. 412/03 had been allowed,\n\nor that the Appeal had in fact been withdrawn.\n\n[34] Applying the application approach to the present case, it is evident that the\n\ndismissal of the Plaintiff\u2019s second action arose from a preliminary objection\n\ntaken at the commencement of proceedings. While the decision to uphold the\n\nobjection brought the action to an end, had the objection been overruled, the\n\nmatter would have proceeded to trial, leaving the parties\u2019 substantive rights yet\n\nto be decided. The decisive consideration is whether the Order necessarily\n\nconcludes the litigation irrespective of the outcome of the application. On this\n\ntest, the Order dated 26/03/2007 must be regarded as interlocutory.\n\n[35] Considering all the above circumstances, it cannot be said that the decision of\n\nthe District Court, in dismissing the second action, was final and conclusive\n\nbetween the parties on the merits so as to operate as a complete bar to further\n\nproceedings.

Some of the questions of law presented to this Court go to the very heart of the social\n\ncontract between a State and its taxpayers.

One of the earliest authorities in this jurisdiction is Commissioner of Income Tax v\n\nChettinad Corporation Ltd. (1954)1 where Gratiaen J. drew attention to the linguistic\n\ndistinction between an \u201cassessment\u201d and a \u201cnotice of assessment\u201d. Gratiaen J. explained\n\nthe position in the following terms:\n\n\u201cThe distinction between an \u2018assessment\u2019 and a \u2018notice of assessment\u2019 is thus\n\nmade clear: the former is the departmental computation of the amount of tax\n\nwith which a particular assessee is considered to be chargeable and the latter is\n\nthe formal intimation to him of the fact that such an assessment has been\n\nmade.\u201d2\n\n37. If this notion were to be accepted, it would mean that under the Inland Revenue Act No.\n\n38 of 2000, the Assessor is only required to make the internal computation within the\n\nstipulated three years, while being free to indefinitely delay the issuance of the Notice\n\nof Assessment.\n\n38. But this is not the scheme of the 2000 Act. Section 134(1) specifically provides that an\n\nAssessor may \u201cassess the amount \u2026 and shall by notice in writing require such person to\n\npay forthwith.\u201d The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d makes it clear that the duty to compute tax\n\nliability and the duty to issue notice are inseparably linked. The section treats them as a\n\nsingle statutory act, not as two independent steps.\n\n1 55 NLR 553\n\n2 ibid, at p. 556 (emphasis added)\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 13 of 28\n\n39.

Samarakoon C.J. emphasized that the purpose of requiring reasons, was to ensure that\n\nthe Assessor genuinely applied their mind to the taxpayer\u2019s return and reached a\n\ndefinite determination. His Lordship stated:\n\n\u201cThe primary purpose of the amending legislation is to ensure that the Assessor\n\nwill bring his mind to bear on the return and come to a definite determination\n\nwhether or not to accept it. It was intended to prevent arbitrary and grossly\n\nunfair assessments which many Assessors had been making as \u201ca protective\n\nmeasure\". An unfortunate practice had developed where some Assessors, due to\n\npressure of work and other reasons, tended to delay looking at a return till the\n\nlast moment and then without a proper scrutiny of the return, made a grossly\n\nexaggerated assessment. Under the amendment when an Assessor does not\n\naccept a return, it must mean that at the relevant point of time he has brought\n\nhis mind to bear on the return and has come to a decision rejecting the return.\n\nConsequent to this rejection, the reasons must be communicated to the\n\nAssessee\u2026 His reasons must be communicated at or about the time he sends his\n\nassessment on an estimated income.

This passage highlights two critical principles. First, the giving of reasons is not a mere\n\nprocedural formality; it is a substantive requirement ensuring that the assessment\n\nreflects a genuine, considered decision by the Assessor. Second, the timing of the\n\ncommunication is essential; reasons must accompany the notice of assessment at the\n\nmoment the assessment is sent; failing which, the remedial purpose of the legislation is\n\ndefeated. It is noted that in the case at hand, it was also the Appellant\u2019s position at the\n\nstage of appeal to the CGIR that sufficient reasons were not communicated for the\n\nrejection.\n\n46. The dissenting opinion, notably that of Sharvananda J. (as His Lordship was then),\n\ntreated the communication of reasons as a \"directory\" step, suggesting that an internal\n\nassessment could stand even if the reasons were communicated later. However, this\n\nview did not carry the force of binding precedent, while the majority\u2019s reasoning is\n\nbinding on this Court.\n\n47. As E. Gooneratne clearly sets out in his book \u2018Income Tax in Sri Lanka\u2019,\n\n\u201cMaking an assessment culminates in the notice on the person assessed.

This principle strikes at the very root of the Respondents\u2019 contention that once an\n\ninternal computation is made, the Notice of Assessment can lawfully be served at any\n\nlater time. If such an argument were to prevail, the Assessor could, long after the\n\nstatutory deadline of 31st March 2008, generate or even backdate a document and"

His Lordship therefore underscored that the notice of assessment itself must\n\nbe issued within the statutory period of limitation.\n\n56.

Just as the bee draws only what it needs, leaving the flower\n\nunharmed to bloom again, so too must the State collect revenue in a manner that\n\nsecures its due without crippling the people who provide it.

The lesson is timeless,\n\nbut perhaps never more important than today.\n\n60.

The Department must act, and must notify, within that time.\n\n68. There is a wider principle at stake, as I noted earlier. Taxation is a compulsory exaction\n\nbacked by the coercive power of the State. It is therefore imperative that the power to\n\ntax be exercised strictly in accordance with law, and within the boundaries the\n\nlegislature has drawn.

The question for consideration here is whether the Court of Appeal was correct in\n\nholding that the Appellant could not invoke its Writ jurisdiction simply because a\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 23 of 28\n\n73. At its core, this question concerns the proper role of the Court of Appeal in supervising\n\nadministrative action and ensuring that public authorities act within the limits of their\n\nlegal powers. The Constitution, under Article 140, clearly empowers the Court of Appeal\n\nto issue Writs of Certiorari as a safeguard to enforce the rule of law. The mere existence\n\nof a statutory appeal, which ordinarily addresses errors made within the lawful scope of\n\nauthority, does not limit or displace this constitutional power.\n\n74. I find the distinction between acts committed within jurisdiction and acts wholly\n\nwithout jurisdiction is fundamental. Appeals are designed to correct mistakes made\n\nwithin the authority granted by law, but acts performed outside the authority conferred\n\nby statute are nullities. No appeal can cure an action taken without legal power. As held\n\nin D.M.S. Fernando and Another v. Mohideen Ismail, where a similar contention was\n\nraised by the Deputy Solicitor-General, the Court held that:\n\n\u201dThere was another matter that was raised incidentally. It was contended by\n\nthe Deputy Solicitor\u2011General that the Respondent was not entitled to maintain\n\nthis application for Writ because an alternative remedy by way of appeal was\n\navailable to him under the Inland Revenue Act. Those provisions confine him\n\nto an appeal against the quantum of assessment. The Commissioner has not\n\nbeen given power to order the Assessor to communicate reasons. He may, or\n\nmay not, do so as an administrative act. The Assessor may, or may not, obey.\n\nThe Assessee is powerless to enforce the execution of such administrative acts.\n\nThe present objection goes to the very root of the matter and is independent of"

I find that in determining whether judicial review is available in the present\n\ncircumstances, it is necessary to consider the principles established by the courts\n\nregarding the interplay between statutory remedies and writ jurisdiction. As Aluwihare,\n\nJ observed in the case ofClassic Travels (Pvt) Ltd v. Commissioner General of\n\nInland Revenue,18\n\n\u201cHowever, judicial review may be granted in exceptional circumstances such as\n\nwhere the alternative statutory remedy is nowhere near so convenient,\n\nbeneficial and effectual or where there is no other equally effective and\n\nconvenient remedy. This is particularly so where the decision in question is\n\nliable to be upset as a matter of law because it is clearly made without\n\njurisdiction or in consequence of an error of law.\u201d19\n\n77. His Lordship further explained:\n\n\u201cAs judicial review is a collateral challenge and not an appeal, it will only be in\n\nexceptional circumstances that the courts will allow the collateral process of\n\njudicial review to be used to attack an appealable decision, when Parliament has\n\nexpresslyprovidedbystatuteanappellateprocedure.Butexceptional\n\ncircumstances may arise when it would be unjust for the taxpayer to appeal a\n\ndecision of the Commissioner \u2013 General.

In aligning with these observations, I, too, am of the view that judicial review is not a\n\nsubstitute for statutory appeal, but serves as a necessary safeguard where the statutory\n\nprocess cannot adequately address the question of legality or jurisdiction. In the\n\npresent case, the Appellant challenged an assessment issued on 11th June 2008, after\n\nthe statutory deadline of 31st March 2008 under Section 134(5) of the Inland Revenue\n\nAct, 2000. The challenge was primarily not to the quantum of tax, but to the very\n\nauthority of the Commissioner General to issue the assessment, which had expired by\n\noperation of law.\n\n79. The statutory appeal mechanism is limited to correcting errors made within the\n\nCommissioner\u2019s lawful authority and cannot provide relief where the assessment itself\n\nis ultra vires or time-barred. Requiring the Appellant to proceed and to confine\n\nthemselves to the statutory appeal would have compelled it to participate in a process\n\nincapable of addressing the legal defect, even after the CGIR explicitly refused to\n\nconsider the time-bar in their reasons for determination marked \u2018P15\u2019 in the brief.\n\nIn such circumstances, where the statutory remedy would not have been practically\n\neffective for the Appellant, the requirements identified by Justice Aluwihare are met.\n\n80.

It is of my view that the Appellant\u2019s resort to the appellate procedure does not amount\n\nto an abandonment or waiver of its right to seek judicial review of a jurisdictional\n\ntime-bar in its appeal to the Commissioner-General and reiterated the same in\n\nsubsequent proceedings. That objection was not only recorded but was expressly\n\nacknowledged by the Commissioner-General, who stated in his determination that the\n\n21 [1985] 3 WLR 1090 at p. 1108\n\nSC Appeal 187/2014JUDGMENTPage 27 of 28\n\nissue of legal validity was a matter for the courts. This demonstrates that the Appellant\n\nnever accepted the validity of the assessment and preserved its right to seek judicial\n\nreview from the outset.\n\n84. The Respondents\u2019 claim of estoppel cannot stand. Estoppel requires two things: a clear\n\npromise or admission by one party, and the other party relying on it to their detriment.\n\nNeither is present here. The Appellant never accepted that the assessment was valid,\n\nand the Respondents never changed their position because of anything the Appellant\n\ndid. From the beginning, the Respondents insisted the assessment was within time, and\n\nthe Appellant consistently disputed that. There was never any conduct by the Appellant\n\nthat could be taken as an admission.\n\n85.More importantly, the plea of estoppel clashes with the very structure of the law. The\n\nstatute gives taxpayers a strict time-limit as a safeguard against late assessments. That\n\nprotection is substantive, not optional. To say it can be lost just because a taxpayer files\n\nan appeal would make the safeguard meaningless. It would mean that by using the\n\nremedies the law itself provides, a taxpayer could unintentionally breathe life into an\n\notherwise invalid assessment. Such a result would defeat the purpose of the limitation,\n\nand this Court cannot endorse it."

In contrast, in the instant case, the Respondents have, in\n\nfact, adduced positive and cogent evidence in proof of the execution of the\n\nDeed marked P2.\n\nThe Appellant also refutes the Respondent\u2019s position that non-objection at the\n\ntime of marking the document constituted a waiver. The authorities make\n\nclear, including Fernando v. Ramanathan [1930] 16 NLR 337, that once\n\nan issue is framed, it cannot be waived or struck off at the instance of a party,\n\nand the Court is bound to adjudicate upon it. Furthermore, the submission\n\nthat the impeachment was not valid merely because no objection was taken\n\n11\n\nat the time of production is flawed, as once the deed is specifically contested,\n\nthe requirement of formal proof is engaged regardless of earlier procedural\n\nconduct.\n\nThe Appellant challenges the credibility of the Respondent\u2019s position"

As noted in the order dated 09.09.2003 (page 224),\n\nthe application for a civil warrant was refused, and no appeal was taken from\n\nthis order.

Whether the guarantee bond (P8) was a printed form that had several blanks\n\nthat were filled later with typewritten details.\n\n2. The lease agreement was neither shown or a Sinhala translation was given\n\nto the Appellant.\n\n3. Whether the lease agreement (P2) was lawfully terminated.\n\n1. Validity of the Guarantee Bond (P8)\n\n1.1 Whether the enforceability of a guarantee is affected by the addition\n\nof typewritten particulars subsequent to the guarantor\u2019s signature.\n\n[8] The Appellant challenges the validity of the Guarantee Bond (P8) based on\n\nseveral procedural infirmities which should have precluded the trial court from\n\ngranting relief against him. His principal argument is that, at the time of\n\nsigning, the bond contained only the printed text and the typewritten details\n\nwere inserted later.\n\n[9] The Appellant in his evidence has attempted to point out to the portions that\n\nwere subsequently inserted. While the precise portions of evidence were not\n\nmarked for the benefit of the Court, a careful reading of his evidence directs to\n\nPage 6 of 17\n\nsuch subsequent insertions to be the date of execution of the guarantee bond,\n\nthe reference number of the lease agreement, the personal details of the\n\nguarantors (entered below their respective signatures), and the name and\n\naddress of the lessee."

He takes up the position that, by\n\nleaving blank spaces in the guarantee bond to be filled later, the lender has\n\nmade a fundamental mistake which makes the agreement void.\n\n[13] However, it is noted that any subsequent insertion ipso facto would not render\n\na contract unenforceable, but rather enforceability would be determined by the\n\nnature of the alteration and the knowledge or consent of the executing party.

As\n\nheld in Pigot\u2019s Case (1614)1 it was established that such post-execution\n\nchanges could render an instrument void, the rationale being that no party\n\nshould be held to obligations materially different from those they agreed to\n\nwhen affixing their signature and seal.

The Appellant also contends that due to his inability to\n\nread and understand the English language, he required a Sinhala translation of\n\nthe Agreement, which was not given to him. Under cross-examination, the 3rd\n\nDefendant-Appellant refers to certain numbers in document P8, which he\n\nclaims include the typewritten parts.\n\n[31] The Respondent was obligated to explain to the guarantors the nature of the\n\ntransaction and the liability imposed on them in the event the principal debtor\n\ndefaults.

If he knew that the act of signing a\n\nguarantee would spell for him disastrous consequences of monetary burdens,\n\nhe should have exhibited prudence. So his assertion that he only signed as a\n\nwitness and not as a guarantor does not inspire confidence in this Court.

    "chunk_text": "witness and not as a guarantor does not inspire confidence in this Court. The\n\nnecessity to exercise prudence was emphasized by the House of Lords in the\n\ncontext of the plea of non est factum.\u201d\n\n[37] The guarantors have not pleaded fraud or force when obtaining signatures, or\n\nunderstanding of the implications. The nature and the contents of the\n\n4 Law of Contracts 1999 reprint, vol. 1 at page 300 5 C.A. Case No. 831/2000 (F) decided on 06/02/2017\n\nPage 16 of 17\n\nAgreement were explained before the guarantors placed their signatures. There\n\nis no evidence that the guarantors were induced to sign the document believing\n\nit to be something different. In such circumstances and taking the above-\n\nmentioned authorities into consideration, the guarantors should be held\n\nresponsible for their actions.\n\n2. Whether the Lease Agreement (P2) Was Lawfully Terminated\n\n[38] It is also contended that by the notice for acceleration of payment dated\n\n17/03/2012, P5, the Plaintiff has demanded that all monies due to the Plaintiff\n\nbe paid within 14 days of the receipt of the said letter. The relevant postal article\n\nreceipt and the seal of the postal authorities are dated 22/03/2012 and\n\n23/03/2912 respectively and are marked \u2018P5(a)\u2019. However, the Plaintiff sought\n\nto terminate the Lease Agreement by letter dated 31/03/2012 (marked P6). In\n\nthe circumstances, it is contended that the Plaintiff has terminated the Lease\n\nAgreement by letter P6, without the lapse of 14 days, and therefore the learned\n\ntrial Judge has erred in law in answering Issue No. 05.\n\n[39] Issue No. 05, raised in the Commercial High Court was limited to the question\n\n\u201cwhether the lease agreement marked \u2018A\u2019 terminated\u201d [Emphasis added],\n\nto which the court answered correctly as \u2018yes\u2019. In addition, the purported lapse\n\non the part of the Respondent was not pleaded before the Commercial High\n\nCourt, nor was it put in cross-examination or pleaded in the Petition of Appeal\n\nto this Court; therefore, it attracts no merit."
